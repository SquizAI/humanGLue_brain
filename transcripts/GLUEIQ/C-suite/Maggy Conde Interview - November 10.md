[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=0.0) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Happy Monday, but it's good.

[@0:02](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2.86) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Now, just to check, you've got a hard stop at 1230\. Is that right?

[@0:08](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=8.0) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Yes. We should be okay, no? Maybe? I think so.

[@0:13](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=13.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's about 25 questions. They're fairly thought-provoking. You'll get a flavor of what I'm doing across the LT. And then for the folks that you manage and oversee, the questions are different.

So the leadership questions and the employee questions are different. And the intention is to kind of measure the gap between how the leadership team sees things, how employees see things, look across adaptability, culture, engagement, and AI tools.

Cool.

[@0:46](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=46.56) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

All right.

[@0:47](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=47.28) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Let's do it. Let's do it. Okay. So we're going to be doing the questions through the Glue framework. Each letter has a meaning.

Surprise, surprise. Let's G is Grow for individual skill building and confidence development. L is Leverage for AI tools mastery and value creation.

Unite is for organizational change and social learning. And Evolve is for ongoing development and thought leadership. So, Maggie, thank you again for taking the time.

This conversation helps us understand where Glue IQ sits on the glue transformation journey across these dimensions. I would really appreciate your candid perspective on what's working, what's not, where you see gaps.

No wrong answers. And the value comes, as I said, from the delta between leadership and employees. And everything we discuss is confidential and will be aggregated to create insights, not evaluate individuals.

So, first question, before we dive into AI specifically, can you tell me about a time when Glue IQ successfully rolled up?

How out a transformation, could be technology, could be otherwise, transformation initiative across the org, and what made it work?

Mm-hmm.

[@2:20](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=140.42) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Transformation initiative. And what made it worked? I actually think we've tried to roll out a ton of transformation initiatives, and I don't know if we have made them work.

Okay.

[@2:36](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=156.96) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you say a little bit more?

[@2:43](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=163.92) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I think we, I think we tried, I think we, we are really good with ideas, right? We're good with like, oh my God, we have this tool, let's say productive, or let's say whatever.

We have this tool, we have this thing. tool, say can She's And It's amazing. It's great. OK, everybody use it, but we don't follow through with it.

Right. So it kind of it kind of gets like halfway done, if I'm being honest, could be that like, you know, we're not we're not as big.

So we don't have like a specific person that is assigned to these things. And a lot of times it's like, you know, for example, we'll be like, OK, guys, just like YouTube it or go to the YouTube channel.

And check it out. And like, you know, just roll it out. And so like, I just think we need to get better at that.

So I don't if I'm being I don't know. It sounds bad, but I really don't know what we've gotten close to it.

But I don't know that we've been successful at anything really transformational, in my opinion. OK, that's really helpful.

[@3:51](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=231.88) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I appreciate it. it's great. It's great context for sure.

[@3:56](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=236.38) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Let's let's start with you on AI tools.

[@4:00](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=240.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What AI tools did you use yesterday or last week in your actual work?

[@4:08](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=248.26) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I mean, I use like the ChatGVT and the Beautiful AI, like just like to me, like the standard, I guess, you know, like I, yeah, the standard stuff like ChatGVT, Beautiful AI.

There's like a, you know, now I can't even think, I can't even remember, but I'm not, if I'm being honest, I'm not like using, I'm sure, as much as I should.

Right now, I'm just doing very basic stuff, you know?

[@4:48](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=288.4) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. What would you say, so taking that a step further, what would you say is the most sophisticated thing that you've done with AI that actually surprised you by the result?

[@5:03](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=303.76) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Probably the creative tool. We've used the Create Toppy and like a couple of other ones where I've kind of played around with it with the team.

And that's actually pretty impressive. It cuts their time like more than half, you know, so I think that's that's pretty amazing.

[@5:21](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=321.82) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And you're seeing the same results for yourself?

[@5:31](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=331.38) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Yes and no. You know, like I like I think that there's things that are like I think like the very factual things, like the things that I like are very, you know, standard.

Yes. But a lot of stuff that I do is very tailored to a client or very tailored to things.

And so, like, you still have to use the human aspect to it. You know what I mean? So I can get up to a certain point and then I have to.

But yeah, I mean, it definitely helps for sure. Right. So up to a certain point. Yes, you can say if you could have an A.I.

[@6:04](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=364.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

expert sit with you for two hours and teach you one thing about A.I. with no one else watching, what would you want to learn?

[@6:17](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=377.12) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Um, probably had a, um, probably the best way to like be more efficient to prompt. You know what I mean?

Like if you do chat each year, like all the prompting piece, I think that's crucial because pending what you put in, you probably get a better output.

I probably am not doing it the right way. You know what I mean? Or whatever. And I feel like that may be the, the thing that could probably make a difference, you know?

[@6:50](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=410.76) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I, we just did a A.I. bootcamp day one on Friday at, uh, Florida Atlantic University. And we did a lot of focused on prompt engineering.

It was.

[@7:00](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=420.0) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

People were mind blown by what they can get by pushing prompting further so it's it's right like right now I don't know what I don't know so like I could just put whatever and I'm sure like, if I know how to prompt it, then you get better results you know what I mean so.

[@7:17](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=437.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Let me ask you this if you were to compare yourself to other executives you know in similar roles, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency ahead behind or on par.

[@7:43](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=463.06) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I don't think I'm ahead, and I probably don't think I'm behind I'm probably like on par.

[@7:50](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=470.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Any anything more you want to say about that.

[@7:55](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=475.5) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Hmmmm No. Okay.

[@8:03](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=483.12) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's funny.

[@8:04](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=484.4) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I'm sure Gaston had a whole good old time answering all these questions.

[@8:09](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=489.98) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We had about a two hour interview going through.

[@8:16](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=496.24) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

But this is like this is like the topic for him right now. So I'm sure, you know, it was really helpful.

[@8:23](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=503.3) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Honestly, it gave me a lot of context and a lot of a lot of insight. So it was great.

If you had to bet your job on one AI driven innovation for Glue IQ, what would it be and why?

[@8:37](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=517.32) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

If I had to what? Say that again. Sure.

[@8:40](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=520.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Bet your job on one AI driven innovation. What would it be and why?

[@8:51](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=531.18) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Give me an example on that. What do you mean by that?

[@8:55](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=535.06) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So it could be, you know, for example, um, Um, um, um, um. Thank It's empowering your employees with more fluency and creative tools.

It could be workflow optimization. Got it. Yep.

[@9:11](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=551.941) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Yeah. Honestly, I really think process, like workflow, that, yeah, that would be the thing that like if we can get all our teams and we can really nail that, we'll make a huge difference in our company.

Um, whether it's process or, you know, I guess it goes even further, like just in each of the areas, tools that can make everyone more efficient would be great.

But I, I even think process as a whole would be, would be very key for us. Like right now that, you know, we're, we're trying to do it, but we're, we, you know, we're half doing it.

Right. Which is partly the one thing I'm really. I'm excited about doing this with you because I think like it can help us sort of, you know, you can kind of tell us, okay, this is where I think you guys should focus on and can make a difference.

And that's pretty cool. Like, I'm really excited about this just, just for that. You know what I mean? So, so yeah, for sure.

All right. That's great.

[@10:19](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=619.461) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's great. Um, talent pipeline and skills reality. This is another section. So who would you say are your top three AI fluent people in the organization?

This is by capability, not by title.

[@10:53](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=653.881) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I don't know. I think everyone's getting by. I actually think the one that's really into it right now is Gaston.

I don't know that our people are really ingrained into the A.I. thing like they want to use it. They probably like take five seconds to see what's the tool out there, OK, and start using something right.

But like really like immerse yourself and really I mean, who's like an expert? I don't know.

[@11:32](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=692.281) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I think the one that may be playing around with it the most right now is Gaston, if I'm being honest, and even he struggles with it.

[@11:38](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=698.741) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Like, OK, there's so much out there. What do I use? What do I do? What do I, you know, and is he using it the right way?

I'll give you a perfect example. Like he's like, oh, my God, A.I. everything. Yeah, he's just like going blind.

And he the other day I get an email from him and he's like, hi, Marguerite. I was like, what the hell is this?

I'm like, Gaston, why? Why are you calling me Marguerite? Oh, I'm sorry. That's my A.I. You got to be careful with that.

You got to be careful you don't lose the human touch to it. That's why I'm saying the prompting, for me, for anything, is probably really, really important to avoid those things where if he sends that to a client, you start losing credibility.

The idea is for it to help you, not for you to lose credibility because you're using tools that are doing everything for you.

So I think there's a fine line there, in my opinion. You know what I mean? But I think everyone's kind of getting by on the latest thing.

I don't know that there's an AI expert in our company right now, if I'm being honest. think, sure, Matt is the most tech guy, I guess you can say, but he's so much in his consulting world.

I just don't know that he really sees AI holistically. It's in his world. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I think maybe the one that's looking at it a little bit more holistic is Gaston, maybe?

Um, but I think that's it. Is there, is there anyone you've gone to for help with AI within the organization?

Probably Gaston. Okay, cool.

[@13:12](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=792.801) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Um, so related to that, um, if you had to put a percentage on it, what percentage of your people would you say are genuinely AI capable today?

[@13:31](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=811.121) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Oh, God, I have no idea. I'd say the ones that are probably experimenting it with at the most is creative.

[@13:41](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=821.761) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Mm hmm.

[@13:43](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=823.101) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Um, I don't know, percentage wise. I'm not sure. I got to think about that one. I don't know. Okay.

[@13:53](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=833.441) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

All right. Um, have you discussed or thought about an AI upskilling? Um, for the organization, and if so, anything you can share about budget, the idea of participation, who would lead it, what you'd measure for outcomes.

[@14:13](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=853.601) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Um, you said an AI plan. So like an, like an upskilling program to get people to develop a greater, greater AI fluency.

[@14:24](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=864.401) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Is that something that's been discussed?

**ACTION ITEM: Email Alex the AI tools audit doc \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=867.9999)**

[@14:26](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=866.141) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

And if so, kind of, what does that, what do those look like? Yeah, I mean, uh, probably like about less than a year ago, I was working with a couple of folks internally.

We kind of like, we did sort of like a tools audit, which I can share with you, actually. Um, we did a tools audit, um, just for process and each domain.

So like, okay, for creative, this is all the tools that creative is using. What, what, what what are the tools?

What Out there that are available, that are the best, that could help with workflow and their work. And we did the same thing for media.

We did the same thing for each of the domain. So it has been discussed. Again, you know, the person that was also leading it left Glue.

And then we just have the assessment. And then we didn't, like, sort of move forward with it until now.

So I can share that with you, actually. So happy to do that. Yeah, please.

[@15:38](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=938.861) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Looking 18 months out, what AI capabilities will your organization needs that you don't have today? And to think about this, we could also say, what would Sam Altman or another tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit the gap?

So what was the question again?

[@16:06](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=966.001) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Tell me again the...

[@16:07](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=967.641) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Looking 18 months out what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today?

[@16:21](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=981.321) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

AI capability, is that what you're saying?

[@16:26](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=986.641) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So are you saying If you had to imagine a year and a half from now, there's an AI capability that Glue IQ is going to need that's really important that you don't have today, what do you think that would be?

[@16:58](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1018.58) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Hmm... I don't know. think, is that similar to what you've asked before? I guess I'm, you know, I'm just like thinking through this now.

Is it sort of like, where are gaps? Did you ask me that? Or no? Yeah, it's different because what we talked about before was today, if we could have something today, would be around workflow process or optimization.

[@17:27](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1047.92) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

This is more about in your industry where things are moving. When you think about the future state of your industry, what might you need to be more competitive 18 months from now?

[@17:41](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1061.9) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Got it. I mean, it could be 18 months from now or now still, you know what I mean? But like, I think the, in my opinion, the whole media piece for me is big.

Um, like. I actually feel media is changing a lot and probably within the next six months to a year.

Even right now, like just like SEO is being done by a lot of AI tools and not the same and like paid search and like just like the way you buy media.

And there's a lot of AI involved and I feel like we're not even at the baby steps. And so like I feel like if we don't get ahead, forget 18 months, even if like six months, it's changing so much that we're not going to be in a competitive edge.

So I think like in that area that that would be where I where I think would be big for us.

That's great.

[@18:40](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1120.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, that's that's really helpful. Thank you. That's a really good answer. We're moving on to leverage. So are you currently measuring ROI on AI investments?

Do you have a metric for how you're measuring the return on investments for AI initiative? Who is ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use, and how does that work?

[@19:12](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1152.5) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

There's no one responsible right now, and there's nothing working. Okay. There's like, am I being too honest?

[@19:22](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1162.66) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, this is exactly, no, this is exactly it, because the goal, of course, is when we come out of this, is to look at all the areas for growth, and then be able to really prioritize a roadmap for developing more upskilling maturity and strategy.

You know, so that's, it's great, because these insights are all really powerful, and then you look at them through the lens of where the business wants to be, and it becomes much clearer, to your point earlier, about, hey, there's so many things to focus on.

think that's... You know, just to add live with you here for a second, I think that's one of the biggest problems that I see is that it's so quickly, there's so much innovation.

Everybody's so busy, especially if you're in an executive position. So it's what do I focus on? Where am I going to get the biggest bang for my buck?

How do I know this tool or this thing that I'm investing in is actually going to be relevant six months from now, like all these kind of questions that, you I think make it hard because we're you know, whether we're individuals, whether we're employees, whether we're leaders, we're, we're, you know, we're shooting at a moving target, right?

AI is a moving target.

[@20:38](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1238.72) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Yeah, I mean, like we did that, the thing that I was telling you, and also it takes a lot of time because you're like, all right, well, let me research.

I think it was like one of the first ones was like we dug into like creative, right? So it's like, okay, what tools are out there that can make creative more efficient?

And so like, how do you even like we went out there and we started looking for tools and then

We demoed every tool and then we're like, oh, let me see. Oh, like that takes so much time. You know what I mean?

And then to your point, how do you know this tool is going to keep up? And how do you know if it's changing so much?

So how? I don't know. Like, I feel it's like really tricky. But yes, agreed.

[@21:19](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1279.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. What AI tool or initiative did you guys invest in but ultimately abandon, walk away from? And what happened and what did you learn?

[@21:37](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1297.06) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I don't know that we've done, like I said, I don't know that we've, I think like everyone on their own have, but like as a company, I don't, I don't know what really like you would say like AI initiative.

We've all sort of, you know what I mean? Unboarded. And maybe like, you know, the one that's been actually the one that's been more maybe adapted has been like the beautiful AI stuff.

But even then, it's what I'm telling you. It's like, OK, go watch some YouTube videos and learn how to like, I feel like if you're if you're going to roll something out in a company, you have to follow through with it.

Right. And you have to like really the beginning part is really important so that it sets everyone up to really use it.

Otherwise, then you don't set people up and then they get frustrated and they stop using it. Right. So I think so, you know, that may be it.

But like, I don't know that we've done like a specific effort. You know what I mean? To to do something big is what I'm saying.

Yeah.

[@22:54](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1374.2) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you give me a specific example where AI dramatically change your delivery timeline? Um, or in other words, what did it make possible that wasn't before?

[@23:13](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1393.16) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Um, I mean, I think nowadays, whenever we do like decks and like, even like for strategy or anything, like it's super helpful for like outlines and ideas and you know what I mean?

Like you literally can put anything and it's like, it rolls it out for you and then you just have to sort of add to it, I guess you can say, you know what I mean?

So it definitely is good in that sense. But again, you still have to put that like the human aspect to it where like you have to tailor it to the client and you know what I mean?

So again, I just, you know, so it does, it does help. Um, and it does cut because it cuts the beginning part, I guess, you know what I mean?

[@23:58](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1438.22) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The, the, the, like where you get to yeah.

[@24:02](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1442.38) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

So that I mean, I think that would be it more like on the strategy and outlines and sort of like it's it gets it to a point where then you just have to focus on like, OK, how does this apply to my client?

[@24:12](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1452.06) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

How does this apply to you know what I mean? So. So I'd say that. Back to the notion of competitors and what others are doing in the space and your answer may be related to media, which you said before.

But ask a different way. What's one thing your competitors deliver with A.I. that you can't match yet? And how long do you estimate until you close that gap?

[@24:43](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1483.92) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Yeah, I I think like media, analytics, all of that, to me, we're so behind even right now.

[@24:54](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1494.58) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And how long before we close that gap?

[@24:57](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1497.58) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I don't know. It'll it'll be a bit..I. I'll just I mean, for us also, it's like we we need to also hire people that adapt AI that are open to it.

So that's another thing. Right. And so I think, you know, currently where we are, the media folks are not they're not adapting it.

So I think we have to start there. And then from there. Yeah. But I would say I would say media media is like the biggest you can not that you can't hide like you can hide creative.

You can hide a lot of the other areas. But for me, media, you can't hide it, you know, because optimizations are quickly you can you can optimize and how quickly you can look at data and how quickly you can analyze it and all of that.

Like that's very notable, noticeable to the client. So using AI tools will make you faster. You can can react quicker.

And like right now, I don't know, I feel like. It's going to take a little bit, unless you come in and tell us all the answers, and then we'll go really fast.

[@26:08](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1568.3) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Well, that's the hope. That is the hope. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. One more question for this section. What customer problem could GlueIQ solve with AI that we always assumed was unsolvable?

[@26:42](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1602.12) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I don't know. I'd have to think about that one a little more.

[@26:56](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1616.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. If we have time, we can come back to it at the end.

[@26:59](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1619.74) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Yeah. First time.

[@27:02](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1622.54) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Next section, Unite. This question I love, which is around shadow AI awareness. And the question is, what AI tools do you suspect your employees are using that aren't officially approved?

And how do you know?

[@27:31](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1651.92) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

What do I suspect they're using that's not approved? And how do I know?

[@27:36](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1656.28) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Mm hmm. Is what you're saying? Yeah.

[@27:42](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1662.34) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Oh. I mean, specifically for creative, I know they're using it because I see it. Like, you know, when you do, when you see something that's very like AI.

Like I literally I'm like, Okay, guys, no, now you've taken a little too far, or you know, whatever. I don't know that we have enough.

Yeah, I guess because we have we don't have like an AI process. So it's not like we have like what's approved and not approved, which probably, I'm assuming that will become a thing, right?

I guess in the future, like, To a degree.

[@28:26](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1706.3) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The thing that's interesting from my perspective. And for I think this is perhaps more applicable to larger organizations. But I think it's applicable to all organizations is that there's shadow innovation that's going on, right?

There's people that are using these tools that are developing valuable use cases that should have a spotlight shown on it.

And then there's people that People that are doing things that should not be done with AI. And we need to be aware of that as well, right?

So whether it's how the Putting in client data or anything sort of related to things that, you know, create risk for the company, but at the same time, it's looking at like, you know, so if you talk about for creative, you know, I guess I would ask, do you have a sense?

Is it, you know, mid-journey, is it ChatGPT, is it nano-bananas, is it Gemini, any Probably all of the above, you know what I mean?

[@29:25](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1765.1) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

All I mean, I'm sure they're all using whatever they find out there. Um, but I, but I mean, I see it, I see it.

And, and that's where I'm saying, like, there's a fine line, right? Cause it's like that, you know, I can, I can tell that's AI, like guys, no.

Like, like, and I guess that, that is my, my thing and what we do. There's certain areas that I think like doesn't impact credibility.

Like I feel for media, it helps our credibility. Right. Because we're like, but for other areas where it's like, creative, or like, you just have to be really, really careful how far you take it with AI before you lose credibility.

Right. So that's, you know, I think that's, that's what I worry about, I guess, a little bit, you know.

[@30:23](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1823.22) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So the next question is about data democracy, and I think I know the answer to this. So you can just say, yes, that tracks, or you feel free to add.

The question is, who in your organization has access to AI-powered insight? And my sense is, from conversations I've had so far, is that pretty much everybody has access to any AI-powered insights or data.

Is that right? Right. Yeah.

[@30:51](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1851.04) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Yeah. And the follow-up is, when was the last time someone surprised you with an AI-driven insight you hadn't seen?

[@31:18](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1878.14) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

When was the last time someone surprised me?

[@31:35](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1895.38) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Maybe. I think like Matt actually did like a little AI thing probably a couple months ago and he got really in depth on like coding and like all it can do.

And, you know, again, very like to his world, it got really complicated really fast because, you know, Matt is very like.

So, uh, but probably that, um, yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool, related to talent and adaptation.

[@32:14](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1934.14) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The other side of that, um, this is about the culture that fosters that. So the question is, can you name three specific changes needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced?

In the organization. Three what?

[@32:33](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1953.84) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

sorry. What did you say?

[@32:35](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1955.28) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Specific changes needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced in your organization.

[@32:45](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=1965.54) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Three changes needed. Um, I think, um, I, I really think, I there should be sort of someone that owns it, like at least initially to kick it off and to like help people with the mindset with versus just here it is, go use it.

Like you have, there's a lot of like psychology in it because again, like I struggle with a few things.

It's like there's psychology in the, I want to make sure that I don't, that this doesn't replace my job.

Right. So there's a little bit of that. So people are resistant. There's a little bit of, oh, you don't know what I'm doing.

And this thing, is it really going to whatever. So you like, I feel like the beginning, you have to kind of like use a lot of psychology to get people like, no, no, no, this is great.

This is going to, you know, help you do more and more efficient and whatever. Um, so I think, I think really like having someone that really walks them from a workflow, but also from a mindset, because that it's a shift.

It's a shift that people have to like, um, adapt to. And I don't, I really don't think just like, Hey, here, use a tool.

We did an audit and like, just go. I don't know. I'm, I'm presenting next week, a whole section on developing an AI future of work mindset.

So I'm, I'm with you. think psychology is really important because it's Yeah.

[@34:39](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2079.5) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Like I'll give you a perfect example.

[@34:41](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2081.16) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

We like, so there, there's, there's that aspect to it, but also the fine line that I keep on going back to the fine line of use the tools, but you have to make sure, especially that we deal with clients.

or even within between each other that we don't lose credibility. That's. That's a great like because if if all of a sudden like I see like, you know, , he does a great design and all of a sudden he's showing me all AI stuff.

I'm like, , what's going on? We're going backwards here. I guess it depends. Right. So I don't know. I feel like that's it's I don't know.

The psychology aspect, I think, is really, really big. And someone has to be able to like, oh, what I was going to tell you.

So. So Gaston, Gaston's very big on like, I need a tool to do a thing, you know, whether it was AI or not, I want a tool to do a thing.

And so like I tell him that that's great, but there's always going to be the human aspect to it.

Like that is super important. Right. So so like we we used to have this like 15 five tool and he's like, great.

I found a tool. You're going to use this tool and every day you're going to give your employees feedback.

I'm like. Okay, sure. And then he's like, no. And then people weren't using it because who's going to give feedback every day, right?

So it's like, oh, every week. Okay, every month. So what happens is, okay, well, do you really want humans to depend on a tool to give feedback?

You know what I mean? Like, you want to build the culture in your company. So do you really want to do that?

I think like once a month is great, but it would be great to just pick up the phone and like talk to the person, like use the tool as a tool.

But you still have to have that human aspect to it. You know what I mean? So yes, 100%.

[@36:36](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2196.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So what I'm hearing is, we need someone to own it. We need to create psychological safety around it. So that it's not it's going to replace me, it's going to help me.

And then the third piece is, how do I use the tools in a human way so that my human essence and the client service that we deliver from a

Values and delivery perspective don't get lost in the AI, in the algorithm.

[@37:08](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2228.24) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

For sure. Because if all of a sudden the client is like, okay, you guys are doing everything with AI, then what's our value?

[@37:15](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2235.32) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, exactly. That's right. can do it in-house.

You know what I mean? So like, yeah.

[@37:22](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2242.24) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

One more data question, then we'll move on to the next section. Um, what happens when an employee wants to use client data with an AI tool?

[@37:33](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2253.24) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Today? Mm-hmm. I mean, we don't have a process in place for that.

[@37:41](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2261.32) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. They may be doing it and you know what I mean?

[@37:44](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2264.88) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

But we don't have like, there's nothing right now that we're tracking or, you know, how would that work? Does that concern you?

[@37:59](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2279.34) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I hadn't thought about it before, if I'm being completely honest with you, had not thought about it before.

[@38:11](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2291.06) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It can be a non-issue or it can be concerning because it depends on how the tools they're using are set up for memory and training purposes.

Because ultimately, when you're using Claude or ChatGPT, I mean, you're basically on somebody else's rails, right? You're on somebody else's rails.

And so as a result of that, the risk is that proprietary data could be ultimately subsumed by LLMs that you don't own.

And so the tricky part is figuring out what is the governance model around what client data is considered proprietary and sensitive versus what client data do we feel comfortable using with the tools on an ongoing basis.

So it's not a big lift. It's something important to consider.

[@39:03](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2343.48) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

And how would you, how do you, like, control that?

[@39:07](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2347.92) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Well, you... Are we going have now UA AI tools to control the AIs? It's really more of a, it's really more of a framework and governance models around kind of explaining to people do's and don'ts and helping them understand the risks.

And, you know, in some companies, it's very much that, hey, if you do X, Y, Z, you could get fired.

Period. Like, this is, this is, this would be fired for cause because you shared trade secrets or things that should not have ever been put into, you know, a third party's LLM that we don't own the data in.

And then as we kind of come out of this, you know, go a little level deeper, we can think about, all right, like where, where are the potential risks and how are we going to create some, some governance around them?

I would say a lot of like the media agencies that are, you know what I mean? Like the Densus and a lot of these like big agencies, media that are really, well, I am assuming they're using some really impressive.

But it's also not like we're so transparent to the client that we're seeing we're doing all this AI stuff.

So I. I don't, I don't know, I guess right now, like other agencies maybe are focusing on that, whereas like, I don't think we are.

So I don't know it's a thing just yet. Does that make sense? Because I don't know that we're comfortable with it just yet.

We may be using it here and there, but it's not something that I, that we've communicated where like the client could have a certain perception.

I guess is what I'm saying, you know? Yeah.

[@43:32](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2612.8) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Are there any anecdotal conversations or, or evidence that you would say shapes that view? Is there anything that comes to mind with clients?

[@43:48](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2628.62) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Um, I, I, I would say maybe like, you know, the one area where, again, I think we lack a little bit on the media, but I think that the one thing

One area where we've gotten a little better on is also creative. And I guess I'll just, you know, we presented this thing for Azamara Cruises where, like, you know, we don't have to do a ton of shoots.

We could do, like, some AI backgrounds that look great and, like, whatever. Like, and the client was, like, so impressed.

But I don't, like, it's, like, a one-off. I don't think, like, we now do that and apply it or, like, use it for, like, it's sort of, like, we're doing it in pockets.

Does that make sense? But there's not, like, an effort to really, like, okay, let's roll this out. How can we leverage it across other clients?

How can we, so, I think that would be it.

[@44:50](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2690.47) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Um, going back to the idea of disruption, um, and this may be redundant. to and,-one But the question is, what AI development in the next 18 months could fundamentally disrupt your business?

But there's more specifics here. So for example, if a competitor launched an AI service tomorrow that made your core offering 50% faster and 30% cheaper, how quickly could you respond or what would block you?

[@45:29](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2729.62) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Um, I think if we knew what we needed to do and we had like, again, why I'm like super excited about someone like you guys, like if we know and we get focused and because there's so much out there and it's like, okay, I just did an assessment and these are all the tools out there.

And these are the five tools that's going to make your business faster and more efficient. And, you know, it's going to cut costs and it's.

I don't think anything is stopping us. We're a small agency that can get, like I'm saying, then we get initially someone that can really work on the mindset of our team.

We roll it out, and then we follow through. There's nothing really stopping us, right? Because we have a little bit more control.

And willingness to get up and drive change.

[@46:28](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2788.43) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

You feel very confident there, but it's understanding more specifically, what is the actual opportunity and what is the road to get there?

[@46:36](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2796.86) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Right, exactly. Yes. Which is why when you told me about all this, I was like, oh my God, yes.

And I feel like this is what a lot of companies need too. You know what I mean? My husband is in finance, and he works for Discovery Warner Brothers.

It's the same thing. They're like, okay, go. Go, go use AI. It's like, okay. It's so like, what does that mean?

There's so much out there. You know what I mean? So like, what specifically do you want us to like, I feel like, I think that's the part that is trickiest.

[@47:16](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2836.47) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. This question I think you're going to like, this is about human value. So as AI handles more analytical and routine work, what uniquely human value, does glue IQ brain that becomes more important?

[@47:38](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2858.99) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Um, yeah, I, I think, I think it, we have to, from a creative standpoint, I mean, each of the areas are very important from a creative standpoint, we still need to add like our creativity and thinking and all that.

Right. And then let, you know, more of like the day-to-day be leveraged. Leverage tools to do that, but also like the strategy, like I feel like, whereas like before you could have an agency that was really good at execution and really good at strategy, but now I feel like if we have these tools that really help us with sort of like that day to day, the actual like human thinking and strategy and ideas become more and more important in my mind.

Yeah. Is there a way in which you think you're doubling down on that now? If we're double, say that again.

Is there a way in which you understand that you and the LT are kind of pushing for how do you double down on those things now?

We haven't really talked about it, honestly. Maybe Gaston and I are like in one-offs or whatever, but like I, like for example, let's say advanced auto parts, all we do is more like strategy.

Strategy for them. I feel like we're in a good place. Like I'm like, like, sure, AI can also provide strategy, but you know, it's not the same, right?

You're like, it's it really isn't. But for example, an account like, you know, I don't know. We have some accounts that are very like execution, right?

Like it's more like just like, okay, let's do creative and like execute banners and whatever. Like I'm like, I'll be more worried about something.

Like that, right? Whereas like, okay, how can we turn that more into like a strategic conversation with the client?

Because technically, if we're using tools and AI tools to do that, so can they there's no thinking involved, right?

So, so that's that great answer.

[@49:48](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=2988.35) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That was the last question of this section. So I want to go back to the one question we skipped and see if you you want to if you if you want to try again, and if not, we can skip it.

But the question. The question was, what customer problem could we solve with AI that we always assumed was unsolvable?

[@50:09](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3009.29) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Man, that's a good one. I still don't know.

[@50:21](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3021.71) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. All right. It's a tough one. It's a tough one for sure. It's a tough one. But these are designed to make you think in concrete terms, but also in abstract terms.

yeah. These are good, though.

[@50:39](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3039.67) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

We have three synthesis questions to wrap up. So what is the uncomfortable truth about Glue IQ's AI transformation that everyone knows but no one says out loud?

[@50:57](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3057.37) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

So, I do As dois, go. Be in touch. I I think it's what I told you. It's like, oh yeah, it's great.

And someone's going to give us the tools and then nobody's going to follow through with it. And then we're going back to square one.

Like that, I think that has been a little bit of a trend in general.

[@51:18](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3078.93) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@51:20](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3080.99) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

even like, you know, it's not, it's not, I mean, I don't consider an AI tool, but like any tool that we've used, you know, like, like even productive or anything, it's just like, okay, go, there's a tool go.

Okay. Is anybody going to train us? Is anybody gonna, this is what I hear from the employees. Is anybody going to train us?

Oh, we'll just go to the YouTube trainings. Okay. But like, again, like for you, I feel really strongly for anyone.

Change is hard for humans.

[@51:51](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3111.05) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yes, it is.

[@51:52](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3112.53) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

And the psychology part is super important to get them on board. And so if it's, It's already hard and, you know, you don't really like, at least at the beginning, once their mindset gets on the, like, once you work that and you get them on the other side, you're golden, like you're good, right?

We don't do that enough, right? We're just like, oh, here, whatever. And what happens is, like, because we don't work that, then they don't, they're like, okay, they go back to their old ways because they don't.

And you have to make it easy because change is hard, right? So if you don't make it easy. Why do so many New Year's resolutions fail?

[@52:39](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3159.43) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's what I always think about.

[@52:41](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3161.05) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

Right, right. And so, so I think, I think that's, yeah, that would be it.

[@52:48](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3168.49) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Related to that, and I think your answer already speaks to this, what's the one thing if we don't address in the next 90 days could derail AI transformation?

Is it the same answer? answer? Is it a build on that?

[@53:01](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3181.51) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

And very last question. What surprised you most about our conversation today?

[@53:19](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3199.23) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

What surprised me most? Some of the questions were very interesting, but I think what surprised me most is, I think for me, I think the question that you were like, who are the three, who are the, what are the three, what did you say?

Competitors or tools out there that are like the strong, I don't know. You, you asked me something like that and I had no freaking idea.

I was like, damn. Yeah.

The full question is, you and your three most AI advanced competitors, what specifically are they doing that concerns you?

[@54:01](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3241.19) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

How do I not know that? know what I mean? But then I'm like, okay, well, where do I get that?

[@54:07](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3247.43) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

There's so much information out there.

[@54:09](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3249.93) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I think that a lot of the questions that you asked me were like, in my mind, I'm like, we should know that.

But then I'm like, but how? Then I go to the how. And yeah, we can Google it. But is that the right way?

How do you find that?

[@54:30](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3270.79) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The way that I would do that, Alex, the way I would do that is I would use a meta.

So we talked about prompting. I would use a meta prompt. So I would go into Gemini, Claude or ChatGPT.

And I would say, I represent a member of the leadership team for Glue IQ. I oversee the marketing domain.

We have X amount of employees. These are a list of our clients. This is the kind of work that we do.

Um... And these are the areas where we're using AI capabilities. Please write, generate a prompt for me that I can put into Claude and Perplexity because I would use two LLMs.

Please generate a prompt for me that I can put in a Claude and Perplexity that will help me uncover who are my most three AI-enabled competitors and what are they doing differently.

Walk me through your reasoning step by step. And then I would generate that prompt and I would read it and I would say, how is this?

Is it an 8, 9 or a 10? If it's missing anything from specificity, I would say, please add blah, blah, blah.

And then I would copy and paste the output and I would put it into Claude and I would put it into Perplexity and I would get those answers.

And then I would go check out those companies and see if it was right. That's what I would do.

That's what I would do.

[@55:57](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3357.15) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

[@55:59](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3359.13) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's what prompt you. That's one of the things, my prompting has gotten a lot better and I've learned, you know, people talk about prompt engineering.

So much of it is actually you can get the AI to write the prompt for you. You give it all the specifics.

I want you to think like, you know, you could even say, I want you to think like an analyst at Forrester or Gartner.

That's the method. So now, now we're assuming a role of someone that's qualified to evaluate agencies, potentially, maybe there's somebody else, you know, assume the role of, you know, name five CMOs that you admire, and have them rank you.

I mean, there's, there's a lot of interesting ways to do it where you where I think you'd get some really, I think you'd get some good nuggets.

[@56:50](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3410.99) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

How, um, so for example, and I'm, you may not be able to answer, but, um, in be a of there's lightester or about Mm know,

So, for example, it's like assume this role and based on assuming this role, provide this. Where does that where do they get that from?

[@57:12](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3432.87) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The major LLMs are trained pretty much on the extent of human knowledge. So I'll give you an example. You know, I'm building this company, right?

So I'll put in a manifesto or I put in like the the assessment that we're doing today. I have tweaked this with AI probably 15 times.

So I've gone through and I've said, you know, I want to use Warren Berger's methodology for asking questions and I want to know where that's valuable and where it's not.

I want you to think, please look at these assessments. This is the criteria of what this is going to put out.

Think like a PhD in organizational behavior. With strong capabilities in AI integration, leadership and employee adaptation and help me evaluate these questions.

And then I end it with walk me through your thinking step by step. So then I have it. And then, you know, I end up Maggie with, you know, these things and Claude that are, you know, this big, you know, they're, they're huge.

And I go back and forth and I iterate and, you know, here and there it'll miss things. And I'll push it.

I'll say, think critically, right? Cause I don't want it to flatter me and say, oh, this is so wonderful.

It's amazing. Wow. No, no, you know, shoot holes in my work, tear it apart, make it better. And then if it misses pieces, push it, you know, no, you missed this.

What about this factor? How about this? Did you consider this? If you didn't consider this, why or why not think critically?

You know, it's, it's a lot. A lot of, it's really, the guy that I delivered the FAU work with is pretty brilliant.

I had two guys. had the former head of innovation at Ford, and I have this guy, Dr. Ernesto Lee, who teaches AI at FAU.

And he's written books on AI. He has his entire, he publishes three medium articles a week that are all fantastic.

He doesn't write a single one of them. He has AI crawling all the hot topics. He has a meta prompt about how he wants it to write.

Noting, don't use M dashes or anything that signals this will be AI. He's got all the coding in for the kind of images that it should create and the way it should create images.

And what he said to this group of educators and MBA graduates on Friday, he said, look, he said, if you're thinking about using AI as a personal assistant,

It's like trying to shoot rats with an elephant gun. He said, you have it completely wrong. It's really about using it as a sophisticated thought partner.

He said, you know, consider this as the best consultant in the world that you have for $20 a month.

It's that good. And if you're not using it that way, you're really not getting the value. And prompting is so critical because without a good prompt, you're not getting the value.

**ACTION ITEM: Discuss prompt-engineering module w/ Gaston; propose to Marguerite \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3628.9999)**

You're getting something really broad. You're not pulling it in to get the depth and the clarity and the insight that you can get when you push it.

And there's a lot of ways to do that. I'll talk to G, but I'm happy to do a prompt engineering module for you guys because I've learned so much about it.

You know, I was using AI in a, in a much more basic way, just, just a few months ago, to be honest with you.

I'm really pushed myself.

[@1:00:58](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3658.09) \- **Marguerite Conde (Nikolas Fernandez)**

I I, I, I. How does and how this could be another conversation, but like, I would love to know, like, where do they where's all this data and who feeds all this data to make sure it's accurate?

You know what I mean? Like, where, like, I guess you have to have to check it. Yeah, you have to check it.

[@1:01:18](https://fathom.video/share/gSZaV5EKGibjjB9N8W7ZjzRGeQFXpj7M?timestamp=3678.45) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's why for research, perplexity is really good, because it will always give you sources and citations. So I really like perplexity for research, you know, chat GPT and Claude, you know, their databases are pretty good.

One of the things that people talk about as a concern is so much of the data now, because they're, you know, these are just, these are just, you know, data vacuums, they just hoover up data all day long.

And one of the issues is that a lot of the data is coming from, you know, sources like Reddit.

So it's like, okay, is that good data? Is that bad data? You know, and you have to, you have to be paying attention, because the other trend, know, mean?

It's becoming pervasive. I don't know if you've heard this term, but it's called AI work slop, and it's people just over leveraging the tools, not prompting correctly, and you have younger generations that are AI power users, but not all of them are thinking critically, so they get big files, white papers, whatever, and then they hand it off to people that are more senior in the company, and they're like, hey, I did my homework, I did my job, and then you go through it, and you're like, my god, like, you gave me this, I need this piece, need this, like, that, that shouldn't be the job of the person that may be less fluent in AI to just filter through all the AI crap that an AI power user uses if they're not thinking critically.

So, and that's, that's a challenge.

Yeah, yeah, so as you lead these folks, it's, it's You know, as you upskill yourself, as you get further and further along in your AI journey, you can push back and say, hey, I love that you're using these tools.

This is great. But here's where you're not thinking critically. Here's where you gave me something that's client facing and there's no attribution around the data.

I can't put this in front of a client. Here's where, you know, this sounds good, but the brand elements are completely off tone for, you know, whoever we're doing this for.

And that's, you know, it's, it's, you need to be, you need to be really organized. You need to be detail oriented in order to get, you know, phenomenal outputs from these tools, however you're using them.

And that's, I'm, you know, if I showed you my desktop, you would know that I am not incredibly detail oriented, but I'm challenging myself to be much more so as I, as I lean into these things and also.

On a daily basis, trying to find how do I put up the guardrails so I don't lose any of my humanity and how I'm expressing myself through these tools.

Yeah, I think that's going to be like the biggest thing, you know? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. Very cool.
