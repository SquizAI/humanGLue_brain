## All 23 Dimensions by Category

### Category 1: Strategy & Leadership

```
Dimension                Score   Visual                    Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leadership Vision        2.0/10  [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Emerging awareness
Strategy Alignment       1.0/10  [██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  No formal plan
Change Management        0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Ad hoc approach
Competitive Positioning  0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Not differentiated
Innovation Capacity      0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Individual only
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY AVERAGE:        0.9/10
```

**Key Evidence:**
- *"We have no AI plan, no investment from a structured standpoint."*
- *"I think much like I'm thinking about the design to dev to production, that's great, except it's something we do ad hoc."*
- *"25% of the people are maybe a little skeptical, but are starting to come around."*

**Critical Gap:** No formal AI strategy exists. Leadership shows interest but lacks structured investment.

---

### Category 2: People & Culture

```
Dimension                Score   Visual                    Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skills & Talent         -1.0/10  [████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  RESISTANT
Cultural Readiness       0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Mixed signals
Learning & Development   1.5/10  [███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Interest present
Psychological Safety    -1.0/10  [████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  SKEPTICAL
Champion Network         0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  No champions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY AVERAGE:        0.1/10  ** CRITICAL **
```

**Key Evidence:**
- *"So people are resistant."*
- *"These kids coming right out of school have no AI ethics."*
- *"I mean, I understand why, but I'm also not afraid of [AI]."*
- *"And there's no judgment."* (mentioned twice - attempting psychological safety)

**Critical Gap:** This is the weakest category. Active resistance exists among staff. No formal training or champion program.

---

### Category 3: Technology & Data

```
Dimension                Score   Visual                    Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Infrastructure      0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Basic tools only
Technology Stack         0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Point solutions
Integration Capability   0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  No integration
Security & Compliance    0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Not addressed
Vendor Ecosystem         0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Multiple vendors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY AVERAGE:        0.5/10
```

**Key Evidence:**
- *"We have some tool sets, you know, we use Motion and we use things like that, but there's no structured process."*
- *"We're trying to build a legacy and a franchise."*
- Enterprise ChatGPT and Copilot licenses exist but usage is unstructured

**Critical Gap:** Multiple point solutions without integration. No data strategy for AI.

---

### Category 4: Operations & Processes

```
Dimension                Score   Visual                    Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI Use Cases             1.5/10  [███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Experimenting
Process Automation       1.5/10  [███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Identified needs
Operational Excellence   0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  No AI in ops
Customer Experience      0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Not AI-enhanced
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY AVERAGE:        1.0/10
```

**Key Evidence:**
- *"Whether they're approved or not, it's good because we want them experimenting."*
- *"Client wants a weekly optimization plan... I want five or six things we do repetitively in strategy."*
- *"I pretty much use it probably every day... for articulating feedback to transcribing meetings."*

**Opportunity:** This is the highest-potential category. Staff recognize automation opportunities.

---

### Category 5: Governance & Risk

```
Dimension                Score   Visual                    Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI Governance            1.0/10  [██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Discussed only
Ethics & Responsibility  1.5/10  [███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Aware of issues
Risk Management          0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Not formalized
ROI Measurement          0.5/10  [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  No tracking
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY AVERAGE:        0.875/10
```

**Key Evidence:**
- *"These kids coming right out of school have no AI ethics."*
- *"Alex Schwartz asked what single thing, if not addressed in the next 90 days, could derail GlueIQ's AI transformation."*
- *"We don't track or trace how much people actually produce and the quality of what they produce."*

**Critical Gap:** No formal governance framework. ROI not measured.

### Short-Term (30-90 Days)
1. **Develop AI Strategy Document** - Address the "no AI plan" gap.
2. **Implement Governance Framework** - Address ethics concerns raised.
3. **Standardize Tool Stack** - Reduce tool sprawl, ensure enterprise licenses.

### Medium-Term (90-180 Days)
1. **Process Automation Pilots** - Start with identified repetitive tasks.
2. **ROI Measurement System** - Begin tracking AI productivity gains.
3. **Champion Network** - Expand champions to each department.
