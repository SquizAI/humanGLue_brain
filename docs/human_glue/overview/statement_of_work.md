# Statement of Work: Human Glue

## Background

Organizations today face unprecedented challenges in maintaining engagement, effectiveness, and cohesion. These challenges have resulted in broken employment models and value equations between organizations and their employees.

Research into the Future of Work has identified the drivers of many of these changes and their implications for employees, leadership, organizations, and their culture. These implications have been analyzed for both short-term (next 5 years) and long-term (after 2030) horizons.

Human Glue aims to bring a new set of products, tools, and approaches to the marketplace to address these organizational challenges, create effective organizations, reset the value equation between organizations and their employees, and enable both to thrive.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. Review and refine the AI-powered assessment tool developed by Matty Squarzoni
2. Design and implement workshops for pilot organizations
3. Develop a comprehensive Human Glue Toolbox
4. Conduct customer research to validate the approach
5. Create a sales strategy and go-to-market plan
