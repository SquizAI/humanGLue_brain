# Voice Response Scoring Rubric for 23-Dimension Assessment

## Core Scoring Philosophy
Voice responses are scored based on **specificity**, **sophistication**, **scope**, and **sentiment**. Each dimension receives a 0-10 score based on response patterns.

## Universal Scoring Matrix

### Level 0-1: Pre-Awareness
**Response Characteristics:**
- Silence, very long pauses (>10 seconds)
- "I don't know" / "Not sure" / "Never thought about it"
- Deflection: "That's not my area" / "Someone else handles that"
- Denial: "We don't need that" / "That's not relevant to us"

**Linguistic Markers:**
- Negative sentiment
- Past tense for failed attempts
- Defensive tone
- No concrete examples

**Score Assignment:**
- 0: Complete unawareness or denial
- 1: Awareness exists but no action or understanding

### Level 2-3: Exploratory
**Response Characteristics:**
- "We're looking into..." / "Starting to explore..."

## Dimension-Specific Scoring Adjustments

### Technical Dimensions

**Reduce Score If:**
- Vague technical language
- Confusion about technical concepts
- Outsourcing without understanding

### Business Dimensions
**Additional Weight For:**
- Financial metrics cited
- Market share or competitive data
- Customer impact metrics
- Strategic alignment evidence

**Reduce Score If:**
- No business case articulated
- Unclear on ROI or value
- Technology for technology's sake

### Human Dimensions
**Additional Weight For:**
- Employee engagement metrics

- Skills development programs
- Change management evidence

**Reduce Score If:**
- Top-down only approach
- No employee voice
- Resistance indicators

### Governance Dimensions

## Response Quality Modifiers

### Positive Modifiers (+0.5 to +1.5)
- **Storytelling**: Specific anecdote with outcome
- **Self-Awareness**: Acknowledges gaps honestly  
- **Vision Clarity**: Articulates future state well
- **Evidence-Based**: Cites data or metrics
- **Cross-Functional**: Shows system thinking

### Negative Modifiers (-0.5 to -1.5)
- **Vagueness**: No specific examples
- **Inconsistency**: Contradicts earlier responses
- **Deflection**: Avoids direct answers
- **Overconfidence**: Claims without evidence
- **Narrow View**: Silo thinking

---

## Sentiment Analysis Integration

### Enthusiasm Indicators (Boost Score)
- Excited tone, faster speaking pace
- Multiple examples volunteered
- Building on ideas spontaneously
- Asking questions back
- "I'm glad you asked..."

### Resistance Indicators (Lower Score)
- Flat affect, minimal responses
- "But" statements dominating
- Focus on why things won't work
- Compliance rather than commitment language
- Long pauses before answering

---

## Scoring Calculation Formula

```
Dimension Score = Base Level (0-10) + Quality Modifiers (-1.5 to +1.5) + Sentiment Adjustment (-1 to +1)

Final Score = BOUNDED(0, Dimension Score, 10)
```

### Example Scoring

**Question**: "How do you measure AI ROI?"

**Response A**: "We don't really measure it specifically."
- Base Level: 1 (awareness but no action)
- Quality Modifier: -0.5 (vague)
- Sentiment: -0.5 (dismissive)
- **Final Score: 0**

**Response B**: "We track hours saved and error rates. Our chatbot saves 200 hours monthly."
- Base Level: 5 (operational with metrics)
- Quality Modifier: +1 (specific evidence)
- Sentiment: +0.5 (confident)
- **Final Score: 6.5**

**Response C**: "We have a comprehensive ROI framework tracking efficiency gains, revenue impact, and innovation metrics. Last quarter, AI contributed $2M in new revenue and 30% cost reduction in operations. We're actually teaching other companies our methodology."
- Base Level: 8 (industry leadership)
- Quality Modifier: +1.5 (evidence + vision + teaching)
- Sentiment: +1 (enthusiastic)
- **Final Score: 10**

## Aggregation Rules

### Dimension Scoring
- Take average of all questions within dimension
- Weight by question importance (T>C>S)
- Apply dimension weight to overall score

### Category Scoring
- Technical: Average of 5 technical dimensions
- Business: Average of 5 business dimensions  
- Human: Average of 5 human dimensions
- Governance: Average of 4 governance dimensions
- Cross-Functional: Average of 4 CF dimensions

### Overall Maturity Score
```
Overall = (Technical × 0.25) + (Business × 0.30) + (Human × 0.20) + (Governance × 0.15) + (Cross-Functional × 0.10)
```

### Confidence Intervals
- 3-5 questions per dimension: ±1.5 confidence
- 6-8 questions per dimension: ±1.0 confidence
- 9+ questions per dimension: ±0.5 confidence

- **Traditional Industries**: Lower baseline (+0.5 adjustment)
- **Startups**: Focus on vision over current state

### Role Adjustments
- **C-Suite**: Expect strategic perspective
- **Technical Roles**: Expect implementation details
- **HR Roles**: Expect cultural perspective
- **Finance Roles**: Expect ROI focus

### Cultural Adjustments
