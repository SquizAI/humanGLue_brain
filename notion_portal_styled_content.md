## 🎯 Final Thought

/callout 💡 The Investment Perspective
*From Alex Schwartz, Chief Transformation Officer*

"Every agency that's now leading their market with AI started with this same decision. They looked at $25,000 not as a cost, but as the unlock code for their future. 

In 18 months, you'll either be grateful you invested today, or wondering why you waited. The only wrong decision is no decision."

**The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.**
**The second best time is now.**
