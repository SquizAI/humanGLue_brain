## Executive Summary

This case study examines how Human Glue partnered with GlobalFinance (a pseudonym), a Fortune 500 financial services company with over 45,000 employees across 30 countries, to implement our AI-Powered Workforce Transformation services. Facing rapid technological disruption and significant skills gaps, GlobalFinance engaged Human Glue to redesign their workforce strategy, implement AI-powered skills assessment and development tools, and create a sustainable approach to continuous learning and talent mobility.

The 12-month engagement resulted in:
- 27% reduction in critical skills gaps across technology roles
- 32% increase in internal mobility
- $14.2M in recruitment cost savings through internal talent redeployment
- 22% improvement in employee engagement scores related to career development
- 18% reduction in time-to-proficiency for reskilled employees

## Client Challenge

GlobalFinance faced multiple workforce challenges that threatened their competitive position:

### Skills Obsolescence and Talent Gaps
The company's traditional workforce planning model couldn't keep pace with rapidly evolving skill requirements. According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025, 39% of workers' core skills will change by 2030, a challenge acutely felt in the financial services sector (World Economic Forum, 2025).

### Limited Visibility into Workforce Capabilities
Despite significant investments in HR technology, GlobalFinance lacked a comprehensive view of their workforce's skills and capabilities. Managers struggled to identify internal talent for critical roles, resulting in unnecessary external hiring and missed opportunities for employee development.

### Siloed Learning and Development
The company's learning programs were fragmented across business units, with inconsistent quality and limited personalization. Only 23% of employees felt their learning experiences were relevant to their career aspirations.

### AI Adoption Challenges
While GlobalFinance had invested heavily in AI technologies, they struggled with adoption. McKinsey's research shows that only 1% of companies describe their AI deployments as "mature," a statistic that resonated with GlobalFinance's leadership (McKinsey, 2025).

### Employee Retention Concerns
High-potential employees were leaving for competitors offering more advanced technologies and clearer career progression. This aligned with VerifyEd's 2025 research showing that 94% of workers stay longer at companies that invest in their career development (VerifyEd, 2025).
