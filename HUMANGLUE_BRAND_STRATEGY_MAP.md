#### **Stage 4: Proposal & Negotiation**

**"We already have engagement surveys"**
→ *"That's great—engagement is one important dimension. What we provide is a comprehensive view across 23 dimensions including AI readiness, leadership effectiveness, cultural dynamics, and system-level transformation capacity. Most organizations find 70% of our insights are in areas they weren't previously measuring."*

**"How is this different from [competitor]?"**
→ *"Great question. Unlike [engagement platforms], we go beyond surveys to assess strategic readiness for AI transformation. Unlike [consulting firms], we deliver insights in weeks not months, at a fraction of the cost. And unlike [assessment tools], we provide workshops and implementation tools—not just a report."*

**"We don't have budget for this right now"**
→ *"I understand budget constraints. Help me understand—what's the cost of not addressing this? If you're losing top performers due to lack of development, that's $200K-$500K per person in replacement costs alone. Most organizations find our assessment pays for itself within the first quarter through improved retention."*

**"We're too busy right now"**
→ *"That's exactly why this matters. Organizations that are 'too busy' to assess are often too busy because of organizational inefficiencies we could help address. Our process is designed for busy teams—it requires less than 2 hours per employee and delivers insights within 2 weeks."*

**Our strategy** is executable: thought leadership to build awareness, consultative sales to demonstrate value, and exceptional delivery to drive expansion and referrals.

That's where HumanGlue comes in.
