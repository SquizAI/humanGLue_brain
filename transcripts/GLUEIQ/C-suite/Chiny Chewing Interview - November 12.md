[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=0.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Connecting, recording. All right. So, chiny, here we go. So I'm going to take you through the reality gap assessment, where AI strategy meets human truth.

And the power here is in the delta between leadership and employees. And we're going to be using the human glue transformation framework.

The glue transformation model G stands for grow, which is individual skill building and confidence development. L is leverage AI tool use mastery and value creation.

Unite is social learning, thought leadership and organizational change. And evolve is ongoing development. So I will take you through this.

So I really appreciate the time. Thank you for doing this. This conversation helps us understand where glue IQ sits on this journey.

And I'm particularly particularly I'm in your candid and open responses on what's working, what's not, where you see gaps.

No wrong answers. The value comes from comparing leadership and employee perspectives to unearth opportunities. And everything we discussed is confidential and will be aggregated to create insights, not evaluate individuals.

And that's an important point.

[@1:21](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=81.46) \- **chiny**

That was going be my question. Yeah, yeah.

[@1:24](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=84.66) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So this will all be anonymized. So before we dive into AI specifically, can you tell me a time when Glue IQ successfully rolled out a transformation initiative across the organization?

And what made that adoption work? So this could be technology. This could be process. This could be a new capability transformation initiative in your tenure there that worked and why.

[@2:11](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=131.3) \- **chiny**

I'm not sure any of them have been that successful. But I do think that they rolled out this project management platform called Productive that I feel like has gotten a lot of adoption faster than any other sort of tool that we've kind of grinded through adopting.

And I don't know if it's because it's better or faster or because it was better than the thing before it.

And so, you know, but, you know, I think that might be the only thing I can think of. I mean, in terms of like, we, you know, we.

Just reorganized probably, I don't know, eight, nine months ago, around two business units, not unlike the sapient world. And I think that that is, you know, as a transformational thing, I think it's working really well in some places and, you know, experiencing a lot of challenges in others.

So I don't know. I don't think that, I think glue suffers from undercommunication. Okay. And so, you know, 10 people will have 10 different interpretations of something, because you just, you know, you see the world as you are.

So without like, I'm a big believer in like, you know, you have your sort of your purpose, and you reiterate it over and over again, and you bring it to bear in any kind of change, and you create accountability under that umbrella.

We make a lot of assumptions. Hmm. So I think assumptions are kind of our enemy.

[@4:06](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=246.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And you make assumptions because things have been under-communicated?

[@4:10](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=250.38) \- **chiny**

Yeah, we make assumptions that everybody's right there with you as leadership.

[@4:15](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=255.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And so we under-communicate.

[@4:18](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=258.14) \- **chiny**

That's gotten better in the last year, but like we under-communicate, we under... I was trying to think of a woman from Sapient, Mary.

She was in internal communications. Did know her? She had like two first names. Anyway, she was like obsessive about like how often Herrick needed to go in front of the people and say the things and build the frame and build on the last thing.

And we undervalued that, I think, you know? But I see now how like that, the voice of centering wherever you're trying to go.

is critical. And I think we underdo that. So I think all transformations get underserved, because you're sort of left to your own devices to figure it out.

[@5:12](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=312.28) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And in a remote world, it becomes arguably even more important.

[@5:16](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=316.54) \- **chiny**

Sure. Yeah. You say to clients or client presentations, tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them, and then tell them again, you know, and I'm not sure we apply that.

[@5:32](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=332.14) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about your AI use personally. What AI tools did you use yesterday, this week, or last week in your actual work?

[@5:47](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=347.7) \- **chiny**

GPT. Okay.

[@5:49](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=349.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Any other tools?

[@5:52](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=352.5) \- **chiny**

You know, besides Siri and Alexa, not really.

[@5:56](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=356.1) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. That's great. That's helpful. Related to that, if you could have an AI expert sit with you for two hours and teach you one thing about AI with no one watching, what would you want to learn?

[@6:19](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=379.14) \- **chiny**

I would want to learn more utility for how it can amplify what I think I already do. You know, like I am not so interested in being AI literate as it comes to like production speed in terms of like making videos or making, you know, or building graphics or whatever.

I don't do that. And so I'm not so interested. I'm curious about it. I'm fascinated by it. Um, but

I live in the world of like strategic insightfulness. So I would just want to know how I could just, I could amplify that even more, even more, even more, you know, that's the value that I have found from chat.

So that's what I would want to know. I would want to know more about how to get better at what I think I do.

And also I would like to know what I don't know about that world. Yeah.

[@7:31](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=451.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Does that make sense?

[@7:32](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=452.76) \- **chiny**

Like I'm not so into productivity tools and production tools and all that stuff. I'm fascinated by them. And I'm in awe of the curious that like go down those roads.

But I just want to know what I don't know about how to get better at what I do.

[@7:53](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=473.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Was that too narrow?

[@7:54](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=474.86) \- **chiny**

No, it's really good.

[@7:57](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=477.78) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Um, No, Is there one particular area within what you do that you would really love? Like when you think about kind of holistically, is there a particular skill area that you think, wow, I think there's a big unlock here with AI?

[@8:21](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=501.38) \- **chiny**

Well, I'll tell you what I have found personally in my work, and maybe that's the thing that makes my heart race in a great way.

You know, I think in general, like to lead anything, you have to know the difference, you have to have judgment, right?

The difference between, in my world, a great idea and the right great idea. So I don't think you can replace that.

I think that is what you, you know, that is what I hope I bring to bear. What I am able to do is kiss more frogs faster.

I can't. And collect a million insights so fast that I can get to the things that are valuable a lot faster.

So it's not that I am looking to sort of get a shortcut. It's more of a catalyst. My process is very wandering and it's deep and it's wide and all those things.

And I am a huge believer in the process. The process is what gets you to the right thing. So I don't want to lose the process.

I don't want to just ask and be given and execute. I want to create a richer, deeper pool of things to shop from.

And then I bring what I think I bring to bear in terms of value to what I do at Glue and really how I try to live my life.

It's like then, you know, find the nuggets. Know which are the... Right. Nuggets, like just have more to work with faster.

[@10:04](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=604.641) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's what I'm hearing.

[@10:05](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=605.761) \- **chiny**

The process is, you know, it's cumbersome and it takes a long time and people don't always understand like why it takes me so long to get to the thing.

Even if it's the right thing, the right thing that's selling 10 more things, you know, it's like, it just, it's, it becomes a catalyst.

I'm not looking for it to replace what I bring though, which I think is valuable.

[@10:33](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=633.681) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Is that the answer? That's a great answer. Yeah, it's a great answer. Tell me about a time when AI revealed something that completely surprised you or challenged your assumptions.

And if so, what did you learn?

[@10:53](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=653.421) \- **chiny**

Um, say the question again, when it did what? Tell me a time when AI.

[@10:59](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=659.581) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Bye. Bye. Revealed something that completely surprised you or challenged your assumptions. What did you learn?

[@11:16](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=676.781) \- **chiny**

Well, I can give you a personal example and a work example. You want the work example, I'm guessing. Work example, yeah.

[@11:24](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=684.521) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@11:27](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=687.821) \- **chiny**

So in the world of prompts, you know, you try to get smarter and better and sharper and you give the AI, you know, a very specific role.

And then I'm always like, all right, now I have this idea that I love, you know, ask, you know, ask Lee Clow and Steve Jobs to evaluate it.

And, you know, and you just like sharpen and sharpen and sharpen and sharpen. But the great aha to me, which is.

What so helpful is, when I start down a road, what I'm learning to do is say, but before you answer, what do you need to know from me in order to respond with 90% certainty or clarity or whatever?

And so, um, that has been a huge unlock that like, that it's a partnership that I feel like I have with chat versus a solution.

Yeah.

[@12:42](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=762.081) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's a delicious partnership.

[@12:44](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=764.101) \- **chiny**

Like it's the best creative partner I have ever had. And I've worked with Jose Reyes, who is amazing, you know?

But he would probably agree. I just feel like it just responds so quickly that I. Can just keep moving in my train of thought.

But I think the unlock is that it's, it is, it is such a valuable partner.

[@13:09](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=789.841) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

You're, you're, you're spot on. That's a very mature and correct way to view it. Ernesto said last week, if you're using any of these LLMs like a personal assistant, it's like using an elephant gun to shoot a rodent.

It just does not fit for purpose. And what you're talking about are kind of the various flavors of how do you do prompting better through context engineering.

You're talking about assuming a role, which I do as well. You're talking about, you I frequently say, what do you need?

And then I'll frequently say, walk me through your thinking step by step. Those, you know, outputs, think critically, don't flatter me.

That's something I often.

[@14:00](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=840.661) \- **chiny**

Never tell it that. Oh.

[@14:03](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=843.501) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm just kidding. Yeah, you got to like say, all right, thanks, but yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it's like having, you know, a McKinsey level consultant for $20 a month.

[@14:19](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=859.401) \- **chiny**

That you trust and that you love even. I dare say that about the technology. That's like, challenge me in a way that, you know, my adult kid would on this theory.

Or challenge me, you know, challenge my thinking. Make a case for and against what I think is the answer here.

Which I think becomes like this great, it makes you a better version of yourself. I don't know if you're going to get to this at any point.

But like, you know, my sort of hot take on it, and everybody's got one, is that I just feel like people.

Particularly in my work world, not necessarily at Glue, but in my, you know, in my world, want it to replace what they do.

Like, they just, like, it just feels so lazy. Like, it's just, like, you, I think it susses out the curious.

This whole, like, technological shift is sussing out. As a leader, that's how, that's the dimension on which I would evaluate people in their adoption of it.

It's, like, the curious. Like, it, you know, like, I could kind of get an off point with your question.

But, yes, I do think that the big unlock is that it's a partner, a great partner. A great partner, yeah.

[@15:51](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=951.021) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Compared to other executives you know in similar roles, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency? Ahead?

[@16:06](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=966.441) \- **chiny**

It's a messy question because people use it for different things, you know? I think for what I use it for, I feel like I am ahead.

But compared to, you know, the fact that I'm using one platform and I'm okay with that, some people even in my organization might say that I'm behind, you know?

You you're enjoying building proficiency in a single tool that helps you in a myriad of ways.

[@16:34](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=994.321) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But it's not a but, it's an and that also keeps you within that tool without a current desire to want to use other tools.

[@16:44](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1004.84) \- **chiny**

Right. I'm open to other tools. I just, I don't know what they are. Yeah. And I'm getting back to sort of addressing the gap.

Like, how the hell am I supposed to find out? You know, like, I... I'm so happy with what I'm doing, but I am curious.

I would love to know if I had that two-hour session. I would love to know how to do more with something that's even better.

And I even ask other friends of mine that do similar work in other places, like what they use or whatever.

But it's just like even like the time to learn it. I'm like, there should be like in this moment where we're saying that this is the greatest technological shift to the workplace ever.

It's the most important thing ever. The expectation is so high. And yet we give it so little attention in terms of how to get there.

Like I'm like that, that feels like a huge disconnect. So like there should be a pit for this, you know, even just, you know, whatever pit is in whatever world.

Right. But see how we're all scarred by pits. The, there should be a place. It's a long time every week.

Even if people cheat it or whatever, it's a signal that it matters that you have taken five hours this week to upskill, to push, to push, to push, to learn.

I signed up for a class last week. It was three hours for three days. I had to upgrade my signup to be able to see the replays because I couldn't get to it when they offered it during the day in live.

It's like, yes, I want to get better and I want to do more, but that was not the question.

The question is, how do I compare to other people? So that's my answer. In my world, I think I'm doing good, but compared to others, I'm not trying to learn everything AI can do.

[@18:49](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1129.5) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's a perfect answer and you're challenging yourself, you're pushing yourself, and you see the value. And I think mapping it back to the context on how do you create.

[@19:02](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1142.44) \- **chiny**

So as an organization, how do you demonstrate your prioritization of it? Not just say, you're not going to get replaced by AI, you're to get replaced by somebody who uses AI.

Well, like, help me be that person, you know, like, I feel like I'm doing fine, but I'm not sure everybody is.

So like, I, I just think, yeah, like demonstrate it. What's the proof of that commitment from the top from the leadership?

Yeah.

[@19:29](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1169.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If you had to bet your job on one AI driven innovation for glue IQ, what would it be? And why?

[@19:39](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1179.98) \- **chiny**

God, I don't even know how to think about that. Can you expand on that? Can you lead the witness a little bit?

[@19:45](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1185.44) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Sure. So if you think about the idea, you're going to put your neck on the line, and you're going to say, okay, this is the tool, or this is the way that we must use AI, or this.

This is what our customers need with AI that we're not delivering today that is the must-have for 2026, something that feels pressing and urgent, that you would say, if I'm going to bet on one thing AI, I bet my chips on this.

[@20:22](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1222.66) \- **chiny**

Hmm. Um, I mean, I think probably scale, AI's ability to scale in a fairly small organization. I mean, it's not so small anymore, but like the ability to scale.

But let me just caveat that. Yeah. It becomes unuseful. If you stop thinking. Yeah. And so, you know, G always says that creativity will always be the greatest differentiator.

And I don't just mean that in like an artsy way, or in a pretty words way, or in a, you know, beautiful design way.

It's just like in solution based thinking, like curation, and creativity and using your brain is will be I think is the greatest differentiator.

It will separate the sheep from the goats in the world of companies that do what we do. Because I see so much laziness around it, where you're looking for it to give you the answers instead of feed your process.

And when you let go, when you surrender your cognitive thought to it, then you're completely commoditizable. That's the word of the day.

Right? And you just become, um, you're Cover slide with your little rationale becomes the one of the agency that pitched before you and the one that pitched before them and whatever.

So like, you know, I think scale, but with the caveat that it just like enhances your cognitive capability, the cognitive capability of the people that you have, the people that you've hired versus, you know, becoming like mindless robotic.

I don't know if that answers the question, but. No, that's great.

[@22:30](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1350.98) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's great. Thank you. I want to talk about the talent at Glue IQ, specifically, who are your top three AI fluent people in the organization, not by title, but by actual capability?

[@22:49](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1369.94) \- **chiny**

I have no idea. Okay, that's fair. I know that like Casey Woods is very. AI curious, because he makes music, and he's taught himself so many ways to, you know, make little films faster, and write music faster, and all these things.

I'm not sure it makes the work better, but I feel like he has a big appetite for how AI can...

Are you asking me for very specific names, people?

[@23:32](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1412.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, so you said Casey.

[@23:34](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1414.3) \- **chiny**

Yeah, I think, you know, I'm in awe. Usually I just think, wow, how did you have the time to learn all that, you know?

But I think he's just got like such a, he's just got a lot of appetite, you know, on a lot of levels.

So I think that that helps him. Um, G for sure, I feel like has just invested so much of his...

Because is using it as a partner in ways that I think have made him better at what he's already so great at.

And other than that, I don't really know. I see a lot of people prompting and then copying and pasting.

And I don't think that that's a good use of it. So I feel like a lot of people do that.

And I just feel like, wow, you're so much better than what that says. So I don't really know. That's not fair to say no one else is.

I just don't have any visibility into that at all.

[@24:50](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1490.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What percentage of your people would you say are genuinely AI capable today?

[@24:55](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1495.78) \- **chiny**

I have no idea. Okay.

[@24:58](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1498.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. have no idea. This is a different flavor of a question I asked you before, so this may feel redundant, but the question is, looking 18 months out, what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today?

What would Sam Altman or another tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit the gap? To do what?

[@25:32](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1532.08) \- **chiny**

To exploit the gap. I don't know, read it to me one more time, Alex.

[@25:42](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1542.94) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Looking 18 months out, what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today? What would a tech disruptor do to exploit that gap?

Thank you.

[@26:03](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1563.58) \- **chiny**

I don't know. Okay.

[@26:08](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1568.62) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Next section is leverage, AI tools, mastery, and value creation. And the first question is about AI ROI. How are you currently measuring ROI on AI investments?

[@26:23](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1583.82) \- **chiny**

I have no idea. I don't think I'm tapped in to that conversation or if that conversation exists.

[@26:33](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1593.18) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. Who's ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use at Glue IQ?

[@26:40](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1600.82) \- **chiny**

The partners. Okay.

[@26:43](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1603.83) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

How does that accountability work, would you say?

[@26:46](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1606.72) \- **chiny**

doesn't exist. I do think that I find some comfort in the fact that we have a proprietary version. So it kind of sanded.

The is our thinking, so it's not getting leveraged by general chat, you know, functions in the world. So if you're working an idea, you can be very specific about the client, and you can, you know, and it, so I do think that that was a, is a huge move.

I'm not sure everybody uses it that way, but I find that to be very comforting. I don't have to do aliases anymore.

Um, and, um, uh, I think going back to an earlier answer around, like we make assumptions, I think it is an assumption that you'll use it ethically.

There's no framework that it's, it itself could give us, you know, there's no framework around the ethics. What, what are glue's beliefs as it relates to AI?

Like what are five things that we just should be core? To our AI evolution. I don't know, I'm kind of making that up.

But like, that would be really nice to know. Because I think in a self taught world, you don't know what you don't know.

You don't even know what's unethical about it. Like there's some things, obviously, you know, that seem kind of obvious to me.

And I think, you know, plagiarizing it, I find to be incredibly unethical. But I don't think other people do, you know, so I don't think that's what clients pay for.

And it's like, I'm always like, hey, you know, they don't need us for this. They can do that, you know.

So I think there, that would be my sort of answer. don't think there's anything that's guiding it. But I think it would be so easy to get to something.

[@28:48](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1728.64) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, I'd love to be a part of that.

[@28:51](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1731.32) \- **chiny**

Yeah.

[@28:53](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1733.24) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's, it's, and you know, from my lay perspective, it's, it's not just not But It's not just Thank you.

It's not just the values and the do's and don'ts. I think ultimately, when you're using client data with LLMs, you have to have a governance model around that as well.

So I think the future of work, my opinion, when you go and you become a new hire in the not too distant future, there's going to be stuff in your employment contract about what you could be fired for for cause based on misuse of AI in an organization.

I totally agree. And there should be. There should be.

[@29:34](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1774.26) \- **chiny**

And you could be on the forefront of leading organizations. You, Glue, everybody. Glue could be on the forefront of leading organizations by kind of putting a stake in the ground around these things, I think.

And when you think about it, Glue is also, Gia is a big believer in, what does he call it?

In being a teaching hospital. So hire young, shape people, inspire them, grow them. These kids coming right out of school have no AI ethics.

They have just passed their last two years with it. You know what I mean? The ethics are built in.

It's just, what can you not get caught doing versus, they should be part of the interview process. Tell me about your ethics.

And by the way, they're all getting rewarded for cheating on their tests and their homework using these tools, right?

So they're coming from a system where they're rewarded for using it unethically. Yes. I, you know, I struggle with this with some of our young talent who, you know, who, again, confidentially, like I get compared to like, you take so long to get to something.

They're so fast. And then I'm looking at the work, Alex, and I'm. Like, you never considered the client, the industry, the context, the brief, the strategy.

You just generated this with chat. Like, it's like, Fathom not the only dimension on which to evaluate somebody's productivity.

You know, it's value. So, like, a shift, and maybe that's the biggest innovation Glue could benefit from, is like a hardcore commitment to the value it brings, not necessarily the speed.

So, yes, I think teaching them the ethics, I mean, you know, I'm kind of showing my, like, generation, but, like, but, you know, raising another generation that's coming into this so organically, so natively.

[@31:52](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1912.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Like, on what to care about. Don't surrender your brain so fast.

[@31:58](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1918.38) \- **chiny**

We're counting on you. So we need you. We need you.

[@32:03](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1923.6) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yes. What AI initiative, what, sorry, what AI tool or initiative did your organization invest in, but ultimately abandon what happened and what did you learn?

[@32:20](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1940.64) \- **chiny**

I don't know that we did. I mean, if we did, I don't, I don't really know what we adopted and abandoned.

[@32:27](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1947.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And that was, um, if your board investors or partners challenged your AI investment tomorrow saying prove this is worth it, what evidence would you show them?

[@32:43](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1963.35) \- **chiny**

Hmm. That's so good. Um, personally, like on a personal level, I wish.

[@32:52](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1972.76) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Or as an organization say, Hey, we have this case study or this use case, or we've noticed X, Y, Z in the following domain or team.

[@33:01](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=1981.18) \- **chiny**

Yeah, I, I would, I would make a, I would demonstrate where we have not just had the right answer, but we showed our work, show your work, show how you got there, show how it helped, show what you abandoned, show what you curated, show your judgment partnered with this thing, show where, you know, I don't know.

I'm like, I, you can see I'm a huge believer in process. Like, I just feel like show your work, show, demonstrate to a client, how you're like the value of the brains that they hired is better than what they can get down the street.

Not what tools they have are just enhancers of that value.

[@33:53](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2033.5) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But as a follow-up on the flip side of that question, again, if you're board investors or partners channel. Your AI investment tomorrow.

Prove it's worth it. What question would you hope they don't ask?

[@34:19](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2059.66) \- **chiny**

Maybe it's related. I would hope that they don't ask where I you know, where I or where we where we went with the first answer.

Mm hmm.

[@34:54](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2094.78) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What's one thing your competitors deliver with AI that Glue IQ can't match yet?

[@35:06](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2106.5) \- **chiny**

Um, I don't know. I don't really know what my competitors are doing anymore. Um, probably, you know, probably production capabilities, like video production capabilities, and, um, even um, you know, image building, like, you know, photography, evolution, and stuff.

I, I'm not sure we're good at that. I haven't seen too much that I thought was like, I couldn't tell it was that.

So I, I think we lack a sophistication around using visual tools for AI. But again, I don't know. I don't know.

I'm like not tapped in to how people are really utilizing it. I just see the end result sometimes.

[@36:08](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2168.62) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What customer problem could Glue IQ solve with AI that you always assumed was unsolvable?

[@36:19](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2179.34) \- **chiny**

That's a good question. These are great questions. I feel like I need to go back to the layer and process.

What problem? Tell me again, could Glue IQ solve with AI that I thought was unsolvable for clients?

[@36:41](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2201.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@36:52](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2212.92) \- **chiny**

Sorry, are you going say something? No.

[@36:55](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2215.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Let's think. Um.

[@36:57](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2217.64) \- **chiny**

Um. Um. Um. Probably, like, performance truths, like, we talked before about performance coaching, and helping clients understand, like, what's working, what's not working, they got 42 partners, and everybody's grading their own homework, and saying how great they Their, you know, their meta campaign is doing, or their, you know, whatever.

I think there's a, there are ways to get to the truth that I think would be so, that I think is so valuable to leaders, clients.

I think that is, that could be an exponent for Glue, which I think that I didn't think it was possible before, because it does feel so subjective.

And having been, you know, an agency. I know how subjective you can make sure it is, you know? So I think, like, if you're willing to, if you can handle the truth, I think it's actually, it could be really powerful.

And it can make superstars of those client leaders.

[@38:18](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2298.08) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What was the Jack Nicholson Town Cruise movie?

[@38:21](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2301.6) \- **chiny**

Yeah. You can't handle the truth. That's right. I think there's something to be said for that. Like, it's just, it's, it can be empirical in ways that are, that could be really helpful.

It could be game changing, really, for effectiveness.

[@38:44](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2324.2) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Sorry, I just have to answer one text that came in.

[@38:47](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2327.24) \- **chiny**

Okay.

[@38:50](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2330.5) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. I think, let me ask, let me answer one more thing about that.

[@38:53](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2333.5) \- **chiny**

So I think it would also be really interesting, and I don't know that this exists. But, um, it's also...

I think it's unsolvable, like knowing, you know, like true effectiveness and like affection for brands is a little bit unsolvable, you know, and because I work in a lot of brand narrative and brand strategy worlds, you know, when you get the question on like, like, how do you measure the results of this?

I'm like, you know, like, I don't know if you have the answer, let's write the book and retire a week later, you know, I think there has to be a way to get to that.

I think that I do think that that has been mostly unsolvable. And if we could figure out what, how to build something that could bring light to that, it would be game changing for, you know, for our industry, and even for our little company.

[@39:58](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2398.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Moving on. To the next stage, which is Unite, Social Learning and Organizational Change, one of my favorite questions, this is about shadow AI awareness, what AI tools do you suspect your employees are using that aren't officially proved, and how do you know?

[@40:26](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2426.86) \- **chiny**

I would suspect that people work outside of our protected chat GPT world with their own tools, and their own curiosities have brought them to tools that are maybe not endorsed or gated.

I don't have evidence of that, but I mean, I would just suspect that... That like, because we really don't have that many tools that I know of, that the curious are finding their own, you know, what's making their life easier or better, they're going to lean into and they're just hoping, you know, I think it's just, it's like, it's just the Wild West.

That's the danger, I think. So I don't know how it's happening specifically, but I think the behavior is probably inevitable, unless you bring, you know, you corral it within an ethics, an expectation of ethics, you know.

Yeah.

[@41:38](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2498.42) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Who in your organization has access to AI powered insights?

[@41:45](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2505.78) \- **chiny**

I don't know. Probably Gaston. And probably, you know, I mean, I don't know. I'm guessing. I'd be totally guessing.

I'm guessing that probably Kajawa leans on him really heavily, you know. Because I think he's hungry to get there, to get to the thing, and he knows the thing when he sees it.

So I don't know. But I'd be totally guessing. I think that's the behavior that would drive that thing. You know, that's the profile of person that would drive that thing.

[@42:20](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2540.56) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you name the top three specific changes that are needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced in your organization?

[@42:43](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2563.75) \- **chiny**

You know, probably some healthy cocktail of guided learning and self-learning expectation. Healthy cocktail, not just a remit. Um, I think, um, internal case studies, you know, highly guarded, highly confidential, you know, internal, like keep this at the kitchen table, uh, case studies of how, you know, I would love to see how it helped you.

I would love to see what you did. I would love to see how we, you know, you, you get rewarded for the answer.

You get reward, like the currency in work and particularly, you know, specifically, maybe not particularly, but specifically in our work, um, the win is in the right answer.

[@43:49](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2629.65) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Right.

[@43:51](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2631.04) \- **chiny**

But I, I equate that to kind of like, you know, when you're watching a movie that it's got like a great, like story arc where it's like, you know, Yeah.

The tension builds, the tension builds, and you get to the apex of the tension, and then you get a 15-second video montage of how they solved it, and now we're on the other side of it.

That messy in the middle never goes that way, and I feel like that would be helpful. Like how it took you to the wrong place, how you challenged it, how it made you better, how like internal like kitchen table kind of stuff where the people that I admire are learning and losing and winning with it, and you know, like that felt like a safe space.

Yes. I honestly, Alex, like again, purely anonymously, like we're not a really safe space. Like not, I wish it was, and I love these people so profoundly, and I would leave my children with them, and I would, you know, like all these things.

But it isn't safe. What you say can and will be used against you or how you do it or whatever.

So, you know, maybe it's a way that maybe that tactic is a way that that could also foster this other thing, you know?

When you say it's not a safe space, that's a really important point.

[@45:16](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2716.36) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And again, this will be anonymized, but I do want this data point to surface because it's important.

[@45:22](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2722.91) \- **chiny**

Do you feel like that exists across the LT as well? It's special. That's okay. It's not safe.

[@45:36](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2736.91) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. And the employees feel that as well.

[@45:42](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2742.32) \- **chiny**

I would not always trust them with my life, but not always with my feelings. Okay.

[@45:56](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2756.17) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I know the answer to this question, but I'm going to ask it anyway to be uniform. So, What happens when an employee wants to use client data with an AI tool?

[@46:04](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2764.79) \- **chiny**

Is there an approval process? Not that I'm aware of, but I don't work in the world of data. So it's unfair to say it was such certainty, but I suspect.

Yeah.

[@46:21](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2781.69) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We're moving to the last stage, which is the evolve stage. So strategic vision and thought leadership. Can you name your three most AI advanced competitors and what they are specifically doing that concerns you?

[@46:45](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2805.1) \- **chiny**

Say it again. Can you name your three most AI advanced competitors?

[@46:52](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2812.06) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What specifically are they doing that concerns you?

[@46:58](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2818.91) \- **chiny**

Yeah. Absolutely.

[@47:04](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2824.83) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Lowering the bar, producing thought leadership, that is neither thought or leadership, content in a thought leadership costume, right?

[@47:32](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2852.27) \- **chiny**

The ability to sound smart very fast and create a ton of content is probably an appetite that glue has.

I say this, I mean, all of these things, you know, I'm saying them to you because you're asking for truth, but like, I have a lot of love and respect for the challenges that glue too, you know, like, so I think, you know, it's, it's not.

Criticism so much as it is, um, it's what we grow up well. Yeah.

[@48:10](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2890.13) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I hope we have our own insightful values around it.

[@48:16](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2896.41) \- **chiny**

I hope that we can lead on it. So getting back to the competitors. Um, so lowering the bar, um, um, producing content masked as thought leadership.

[@48:31](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2911.89) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And, um, um, it's funny because my things are not so positive.

[@48:52](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2932.13) \- **chiny**

I'm realizing the things that concern me are not so positive. Um, commoditizing.

[@48:59](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2939.05) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

great.

[@49:04](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2944.37) \- **chiny**

We will teach clients what to expect as an industry. will teach them what good looks like.

[@49:11](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2951.67) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

will teach them all these things.

[@49:13](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2953.21) \- **chiny**

So if you have sort of conviction around some of these things, it makes you a little bit of an outlier.

So it's like there's a lot of education in that, too. I think that's a huge, unique selling proposition. Yeah.

[@49:31](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2971.91) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If we surveyed your clients about whether you're an AI leader or laggard compared to other agencies, what would they honestly say?

[@49:47](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=2987.67) \- **chiny**

Again, don't know. I don't know. Like, so I can't even speak for the consulting side of the business because I feel like there's probably much richer conversation to be had there.

Here we go. With those clients, I feel like in the agency client world, I don't think they know.

[@50:05](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3005.97) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I think they expect you to use it.

[@50:08](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3008.21) \- **chiny**

Some of them are waking up to like, wait, are you using it like for good? Are you using it like to commoditize us?

Are you giving all our away to AI? Are we getting our money's worth or whatever? So I don't know.

We had a client the other day say, I don't ever want to see an M-dash because that just signals that you've taken it from chat.

And I'm like, oh my God, like for people who love the M-dash like a long time ago, like it's painful, but it's true.

You know, so I don't know. Do you want to signal that you do or do you want to signal that you don't when you're in the idea business?

You want to signal scale and speed with it? I think they would be happy to know that we are doing that in some places, but we have clients.

I think I want to post an ode to the M-dash after this conversation. I do, too. I just, like, served us so well.

And now she's, you know, broken forever. She's like a tramp stamp now. Like, like, what? You know the funny thing, though, Jeannie, is that you can just put your prompts into your system prompts and say, don't ever use M-dashes in your responses.

Give me no signals that you did this. Yes. Of course you can.

People are lazy enough to not do that.

[@51:35](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3095.87) \- **chiny**

You know?

[@51:41](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3101.49) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I have a lot of optimism around AI.

[@51:43](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3103.79) \- **chiny**

really do. I just worked on this thing.

[@51:47](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3107.33) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I have pro bono client that's, you know, going to pitch one of the world's most, um,

[@52:00](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3120.01) \- **chiny**

And iconic champions of AI around a way to use it for good. I have a huge belief. They haven't even pitched that guy.

And I bought stock in their company. Because I was like, if they adopt this, this changes perception. This changes so much.

This is like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like a bacteria in the hands of a mad scientist or in the hands of a, you know, a research scientist.

You know, it's like, I really believe in it. I just feel like it's, we're just clunky in our, was it like this when we were, you know, adapting to digital?

[@52:48](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3168.83) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I think so. Because it's so clumsy. It's clumsier now because of how fast it's moving.

[@52:58](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3178.85) \- **chiny**

I think. That's my answer full stop.

[@53:03](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3183.73) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I don't think we've ever experienced a technology that's this game-changing, advancing this quickly, disrupting our skills and our work this fast.

And, you know, I have a slide in one of my presentations and it's a picture of kind of Mr.

Bean doing one of his silly faces and it says, you know, and the caption on the slide is, nobody's an expert.

Right?

[@53:28](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3208.91) \- **chiny**

No one can tell you that they're an expert in AI.

[@53:31](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3211.77) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Number one, you have Dario Amadei at Anthropics saying, we still don't understand what happens inside the black box. We're making it and we don't understand it.

So if you're one of the top three AI companies in the world and you don't know how it works exactly, who the does?

Take me to your guru.

[@53:54](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3234.03) \- **chiny**

Like, yes. Yeah.

[@53:56](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3236.17) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And meanwhile, the capabilities are doubling roughly every five point. Three months, the compute power is doubling every hundred days.

mean, most minds on the planet can't process what that means. I can't. I look at this stuff all day long.

[@54:20](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3260.59) \- **chiny**

I just know it's overwhelmingly fast. I would add to your list of things that's disrupting so fast, the idea of your value.

It's disrupting your value so fast. That is what makes it, I think, you know, it makes some people lean in harder and some people like, you know, like not adopt at all.

Like, but your value is now folded into this. So it's not just your ways of working or your ROI or whatever.

It is your value as an organization. It is your value as a contributor. There's a value as a contributor to anything.

My money slide in one of my presentations is literally just, what is my human value on a black slide?

That's it. That's it.

[@55:14](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3314.37) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That is the essence of this.

[@55:18](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3318.15) \- **chiny**

And you're exactly right.

[@55:20](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3320.51) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And it depends on how you're wired. Do you, are you a frog in increasingly hot water or are you a mouse that wants to go find the cheese who are good?

Um, couldn't have been a better segue. Cause the next question is as AI handles more analytical and routine work, what uniquely human value does glue IQ bring that becomes more important?

Judgment. Yeah. And how are you doubling down on that?

[@55:56](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3356.43) \- **chiny**

Positive thought, like real curation, real. Real ideas, like real ideas, not like, Hey, look, I just, I just thought of these 25 ideas in three minutes.

It's like, no, like, no, but it's real. I like the curation of that. It's a judgment of that. Like, that is the thing that keeps you from buying into the low bar.

Yeah, we could be that. How are you doubling down on that?

[@56:26](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3386.53) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Would you say?

[@56:27](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3387.03) \- **chiny**

Um, probably, uh, resisting the urge sometimes to shortcut, you know, like making everything that I get from AI, uh, components, inputs, suggestions, brainstorms versus answers.

Sometimes the answer is right there. Sometimes you're like, that's it. Boom. But it's not, it's by virtue of the process that you got there.

So, yeah.

[@57:07](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3427.81) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Last question, then we'll wrap up with three just kind of final closing questions. Name one specific AI capability or use case where Glue IQ is genuinely ahead of the market, and what would it take for a competitor to catch up?

[@57:32](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3452.13) \- **chiny**

I would say, I would go back to that performance coaching thing, like this productizing this idea that you can get to empirical truth that is game changing to either the client's organization or to that person's contribution to the organization.

But I think, I think, I'm not, I don't know. I anybody's thinking about it like that, that I'm aware of.

Yeah, that's very interesting.

[@58:07](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3487.79) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I feel like partners just, they sharpen their own tools.

[@58:10](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3490.99) \- **chiny**

And I feel like this is kind of like your, you know, your rude aunt that comes at Thanksgiving and says, why aren't you married yet?

You know what I mean? Like, this is like stating the obvious, but stating it, you know, so.

[@58:28](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3508.07) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So wrapping up, three final questions. First one, what's the uncomfortable truth about GlueIQ's AI transformation that everyone knows, but no one says out loud?

[@58:53](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3533.39) \- **chiny**

Um, probably expectation. Expectation without any sophistication, right? There's an expectation without implementation. There's an expectation without any accountability. It's just an expectation that feels like it doesn't just feel like a coat of paint like sometimes expectations do.

It feels like more important than that. I feel like G has a, he has a gravity to his, to his delivery on this topic that I haven't seen since he was trying to convince Sapient that creativity matters.

You know, like he has like a gravity about him that I, I love on it. And it's an expectation I think people respect, but I, I'm not sure.

Everybody knows what to do with it, and I'm not sure everybody knows what to make sure they don't do with it.

[@1:00:10](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3610.73) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, yeah. Second, what's the one thing that if Glue IQ doesn't address the next 90 days, next 90 days, could derail your AI transformation?

[@1:00:25](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3625.83) \- **chiny**

I don't know, are we in an AI transformation? I guess we kind of are. We don't address. In the next three months.

You know, I'm guessing that the answer you may get from a lot of people, particularly in leadership, might be around capability and capacity.

Mine is going to be, you know.

[@1:00:59](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3659.57) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

don't know.

[@1:01:00](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3660.01) \- **chiny**

Um, from a different brain hemisphere. Um, I think, um, I think we would serve our, our organization and our clients well to within 90 days, um, um, address a point of view on how, how it gives value and how it doesn't like how, you know, here's the other obvious truth is like, everybody's cheating.

Everybody's cheating. So like, are we going to be that?

[@1:01:53](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3713.31) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Are we going to be another cheating?

[@1:01:56](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3716.89) \- **chiny**

that's just prompting once or twice. Copying it, pasting it into the deck. Are we just going to cheat? You know, like, where is our original thought value that, you know, that I feel like he values so much?

You know, like, I would love, like, I want to write that paper, you know, but I wouldn't, I would, I would not feel so safe.

Hmm.

[@1:02:27](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3747.57) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But, and I wouldn't feel like it walks our talk.

[@1:02:31](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3751.29) \- **chiny**

Like we've walked that talk, but I feel like that could be that. That's, I mean, that's what makes you different from the people who were in there with your client an hour ago and the ones that are coming right after you.

[@1:02:44](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3764.51) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. That's it.

[@1:02:45](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3765.85) \- **chiny**

A4? I don't know. You got to put your fingerprints on it, not the algorithms. Yes. The algorithm has no fingerprint.

The algorithm, that, that is a great point. The algorithm. Only has the collection of all the fingerprints. That's all it has.

doesn't even have a fingerprint.

[@1:03:07](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3787.99) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Like, is your fingerprint on this?

[@1:03:10](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3790.43) \- **chiny**

Is your fingerprint? I watch people, like, present stuff in decks that I don't think they ever really read before.

They're reading it for the first time to the client. It's in the presentation, you know? So I love that accountability point.

Like, where, you know, the thing that you would have to, like, the thing that you would want, that clients should ask you, you should be accountable for.

It's like, show me your fingerprint in here.

[@1:03:39](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3819.65) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. Last question. What surprised you most about our conversation today?

[@1:03:52](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3832.19) \- **chiny**

Honestly, that we're in an AI transformation.

[@1:03:58](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3838.11) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's the beginning of one. Yeah.

[@1:04:00](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3840.71) \- **chiny**

Yeah. I feel the conviction around it. Yeah.

[@1:04:04](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3844.89) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. I would say just for the purposes of, of being candid, these questions are designed to talk about a company's AI transformation.

My understanding is that Glue IQ's AI transformation is just beginning to become an evolution.

[@1:04:30](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3870.97) \- **chiny**

there's no, I haven't had any conversation with anyone that says this is fully underway other than we're starting to use some of these tools.

[@1:04:40](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3880.89) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We're thinking about it. We know the creatives are using it. Gosh, we'd love to have it for media because if people are going to be using this for media and we can't compete with, without it, that's a real issue.

There's, so there's clear line of sight on where it could become more. There's clear line of sight around that, from all the conversations I've had, that it's not been communicated in any sort of formal or codified way.

And it needs to be. And this effort and these conversations, I believe, will help kind of guide how that is actually done in a thoughtful, values-driven, authentic way.

[@1:05:30](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3930.33) \- **chiny**

I love that. You know, if you fold in, like, our purpose to help each other grow forward, I feel like, you know, your readout fits it under that so beautifully.

You know, it's like, you know, it's funny because, like, another thing that's surprising about this conversation is that it's framed as a gap, which I get for your, for the purposes of what you're doing.

And I guess, you know, I hadn't really thought about it that way, but it really is, it's like, this is a really powerful gift.

[@1:06:14](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3974.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Thank you, Chiny. Your insights will absolutely help us identify the opportunities and risks, and we'll aggregate all these perspectives and show you where the gaps and opportunities lie.

[@1:06:26](https://fathom.video/share/5rjVviRqvvT1sHEDT8JJM7rwUpou8zrz?timestamp=3986.99) \- **chiny**

Awesome. Thanks for fighting the good fight for the humans.
