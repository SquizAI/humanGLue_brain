## CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES

**Vertical Bootcamp Alumni → Certificate Program:**
- Healthcare bootcamp graduate enrolls in 6-week certificate for deeper dive
- **Conversion rate:** 30% → Additional $375K/year revenue

**Multi-Vertical Executives:**

## COMPETITIVE MOAT

**No competitor offers:**
1. ✅ Industry-specific AI transformation leadership curriculum
2. ✅ Orlando industry ecosystem access (aerospace, healthcare, hospitality)
3. ✅ Regulatory compliance depth per vertical
4. ✅ Cross-college faculty expertise tailored to sector needs

**This is defensible differentiation that creates long-term pricing power.**

## BOTTOM LINE

Vertical-specific bootcamps:
- **5x revenue potential** vs. generic offering ($5.3M vs. $900K by Year 3)
- **Higher pricing** ($8.5-9.5K vs. $7.5K standard)
- **Deeper client relationships** (industry partners become advocates)
