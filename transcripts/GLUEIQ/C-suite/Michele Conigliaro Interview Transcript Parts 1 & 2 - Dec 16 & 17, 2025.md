### 00:00:00

   
**Alex Schwartz:** That's bizarre. That's bizarre. That's bizarre. That's bizarre.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Oh,  
**Alex Schwartz:** Hello.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** hey, Alex.  
**Alex Schwartz:** I'm great.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** How are you?  
**Alex Schwartz:** I'm so sorry about that.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** No,  
**Alex Schwartz:** I'm uh I'm migrating two different new calendars,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** no worries.  
**Alex Schwartz:** so that may be what happened.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yeah, no worries.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I had the invite, but there was no like link embedded or like copied and pasted, but no worries.  
**Alex Schwartz:** great great to see you.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Um,  
**Alex Schwartz:** Thank  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** yeah, good to see you. I have to say I didn't Gaston um messaged me and was like,  
**Alex Schwartz:** you.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** "Hey, like nudging you to reply back to Alex." I was like, "Who's Alex?" And I looked at my email and I had these emails from you. But I get so many messages because I'm on LinkedIn like from recruiters and people that just find my email, my profile that I just like when I don't recognize a name and it's like seems like it's a spam.  
   
 

### 00:13:21

   
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yes. I just don't ignore them. So,  
**Alex Schwartz:** No, no worries at all.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I'm so sorry.  
**Alex Schwartz:** I I do not take it personally and it's, you know, that's that's that's one of the challenges in our,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Totally.  
**Alex Schwartz:** you know, information overload world these days, for sure.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** And people now like when they reach out to you,  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** they reach out like they know you too, like or they're supposed to be reaching out. So, it's like I've learned to just put blinders up.  
**Alex Schwartz:** yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** So, sorry about  
**Alex Schwartz:** No worries. No worries at all.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** that.  
**Alex Schwartz:** So, I know you only have about 15 minutes, so if we could um in a perfect world,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yes.  
**Alex Schwartz:** if we could get started, but maybe just grab some more time uh later this week if you have anything,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yes.  
**Alex Schwartz:** that would be amazing.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** This week is crazy. I'm just going to warn you.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Um, I don't even really know what this call is about.  
   
 

### 00:14:06

   
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** What is this call about? I have no context.  
**Alex Schwartz:** okay, that's a great place to start.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** So, maybe that's a good starting  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah. Um so the context is I am launching a company called human  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** point.  
**Alex Schwartz:** glue and we are focused on um helping organizations and individuals to upskill their AI journey. So to help uh organizations really think about where are they with AI, how is it working, how is ROI and all these things that we need to be measure being measured and looking for how that's translating culturally, how's that translating in terms of you know who's really using it and how they're using it and where are the opportunities coming out of this. And the way that it's been designed that's kind of different is it is a um it focuses on two separate audiences. So we start with the leadership team in any company and then we go and we interview um a group of employees whether it's a domain or a larger group of employees or a team or  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:15:11

   
**Alex Schwartz:** whomever to kind of assess what is the gap between the leadership vision and the employee reality.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Okay.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um so we we call this where AI strategy meets human truth and it's uh the name of uh the assessment is the reality gap assessment. Um and so I've interviewed uh just about everyone except for you and Boris.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Okay.  
**Alex Schwartz:** So we'll be wrapping up with you guys uh hopefully soon and then diving into interviewing about about the 50 or so folks that are in the marketing function underneath Maggie.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Right.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah. So, is that is that helpful?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yes.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Okay.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I'm wondering how much help I will be, but  
**Alex Schwartz:** I'm sure a lot. I'm sure a lot. So, um we can jump right in.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** yes.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um it is the we're human glue. Of course, we have a transformation model and our transformation is a glue transformation model. Um so, it's G for grow, individual skill building and competence development. L for leverage, AI tool mastery and value creation.  
   
 

### 00:16:17

   
**Alex Schwartz:** unite. How do we unite around social learnings and organizational change and how do we evolve for ongoing development and thought leadership?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Okay.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um so,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Like  
**Alex Schwartz:** so the conversation is to help us understand where Glue IQ sits on this transformation journey.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** that.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um and I'm particularly particularly interested in your candid perspectives on what's working, what's not, where you see gaps. Uh no wrong answers. The value comes from comparing leadership and employee perspectives to unlock opportunity and everything we discuss is confidential and will be aggregated and anonymized to create insights not evaluate individuals. So that's really important. Um so before we dive in first question um uh before we dive into AI specifically can you tell me about a time when glue IQ successfully rolled out a transformation initiative doesn't have to be AI and what made the adoption work.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I mean, I don't know what I would define as a transformation initiative um that I've been like a major part of. I mean, we have like I mean, I'm just looking through everything from my lens, which is like a people lens and we have I just don't know  
   
 

### 00:17:41

   
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** if I would call it successful, but um we have we've had to create since we are a younger company a lot of internal infrastructure and processes um around people and team management and um just like standard organizational processes and I would say we've had to I mean these  
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** are I don't know if it's like transformational is this like more baseline things that we needed to roll out around um team reviews um setting up touch points with your managers um annual reviews onetoone meetings company objectives and we've rolled out like a whole initiative around um performance management. So I I would say we've been doing that for a while and it's been somewhat successful and partially adopted. There's just usually um people that adopt and are on board and then people that you need to like chase and really like push to get things done. So I mean that's like the closest I've been to anything.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Um, again, I don't know what the metrics are for success. If it's 100% adoption, then it wasn't successful.  
   
 

### 00:19:08

   
**Alex Schwartz:** No, it's it's great.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** But  
**Alex Schwartz:** It's really helpful context and I you know again this is really kind of pick whatever comes to mind. So you answered it perfectly. Um the next question would be starting with your own AI use. Um what AI tools did you use yesterday or this week in your actual work?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I only use chat QPT and I use Otter for my  
**Alex Schwartz:** Okay. Fantastic. And what would you say whether it's with chat GBT or Otter,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** meetings.  
**Alex Schwartz:** what would be would be the most sophisticated thing that you've done with AI that actually surprised you with the result?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Um I mean I just I pull a lot of data um like data collection, data points, statistics. Um I haven't used like one thing I want to start doing with AI which I have not done because I'm not sure where to start or if there's a specific platform is content design and like slide design. So that's something I do want to explore.  
   
 

### 00:20:19

   
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** But I would say like in terms of like copywriting, data collection, statistics, like that to me is like very surprising. Um how granular and how specific the responses are and how like on point they are. So that I would say is like the most sophisticated things I do,  
**Alex Schwartz:** That's great.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** but not very Yeah.  
**Alex Schwartz:** No, it's great. Um, related to that, if you could have an AI expert, and I put that in air quotes because AI is moving so fast, I don't think anybody is truly an expert, but if you could have someone really proficient in AI sit with you for two hours and teach you one thing about AI with no one else watching, what would you want to learn?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I would want to learn how to design content, how to lay out data in a visual way, data visualization, presentation, compilation. It'd be taking all of what I know and what I'm able to get from AI and visualizing it. So it's compelling and tells a story and can resonate with the  
   
 

### 00:21:31

   
**Alex Schwartz:** Fantastic. Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** audience.  
**Alex Schwartz:** compared to other executives you know in similar roles, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency? Ahead, behind, or on  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I don't think it'd be any of those.  
**Alex Schwartz:** par  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I would say it's like if it was a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being like, you know, very advanced and five being on par, I would say like I'm a four, a four to a six, like four, five in there.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah. No, that's good. So, kind of kind of in the middle. Kind of in the middle.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yes. Like I use it every day, multiple times a day, but I have not expanded on the tools.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Like I've I've downloaded notion, but I haven't used notion. I've like tried I understand but it seems overwhelming to me. So I'm just like I'm going to stick with what I know and just use it within that scope until and I kind of want to go all in on like one more tool to just slowly build the  
   
 

### 00:22:24

   
**Alex Schwartz:** Awesome. Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** repertoire.  
**Alex Schwartz:** and if you had to bet your job on one AIdriven innovation for Glue IQ, what would it be and why?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Oh, I don't I don't know.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Okay.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** That's a that's big ask betting your job on it but um for the organization as a whole not just individual specific roles it's so many things I mean if there was one tool that could take the data the insights the strategy distill it into a visual way and then somehow like I feel like we do a lot of production work.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** So like big creative strategic thinking and I know AI can do that but like I feel like that's where like the human touch and the mind and the relationships like come into um like a critical role. I think it's more like the production work that we're doing like the you know taking what we have and like formatting it into different layouts into different specs and sizes and um repeating it with like ABC you know testing like variations like that would be for our business in particular but if we do a lot of production work it seems like that's takes a lot of manpower and that's something that seems like it could be safely automated or like put into like a tool to help generate Um and then yeah, I would say that would be like the biggest impact.  
   
 

### 00:24:04

   
**Alex Schwartz:** That's good. I really like that. That makes sense for the business, right? It makes sense. Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yeah.  
**Alex Schwartz:** who would you say are your top three AI fluent people in the organization? Not by title, but actual skills and capability.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I mean, Gaston, who you met, I think he is the most passionate and he's like really pushing and driving us to all adopt it and he really takes the time to understand it and try like he tries so many different tools and platforms. I don't know if that was your question.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** He said not in terms of title but in terms of yeah I mean him for  
**Alex Schwartz:** Skills, proficiency. Yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** sure.  
**Alex Schwartz:** So  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Um there's other people like this another person on our um leadership team like Matt for example. I think he's like very techy and like wants like I think he delves into it but I don't think it's in like a grounded way. like if I hear him talking about AI, I like my eyes glaze over because he talks in like such abstract ways that it seems um like he probably is involved and like uses it a lot, but I don't know if it resonates on other people's levels.  
   
 

### 00:25:19

   
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Um and then I'm not sure of the third person.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** And I think there are some people on our team that are like using it and trying to use it, but I don't know like no one stands out except for Gaston is like the person that like  
**Alex Schwartz:** Awesome.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** really is like fully in and  
**Alex Schwartz:** No, that's great.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** immersed.  
**Alex Schwartz:** That's great. Um, I know we're coming close to time, so I'm going to ask you, um, one more question and then if we can look to grab some more time, that would be awesome. Um, what percentage of your people would you say are genuinely AI capable today?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** What defines capable? like capable like am I considered capable of just like those two platforms I'm using or is  
**Alex Schwartz:** It's It's your own definition.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** it  
**Alex Schwartz:** It's your own definition.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** um 40 to  
**Alex Schwartz:** That's good. That's good. That's really strong.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** 60%.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah. Yeah. Um, so there's a bunch more.  
   
 

### 00:26:28

   
**Alex Schwartz:** There's 25 questions in total. So it typically we're going quickly which is great.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Okay.  
**Alex Schwartz:** So I think we can definitely do this in an hour. Um so if we could grab uh maybe another 45 minutes um at some point later this week that Yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Can we knock out a few more right now just to get This week is like the craziest week I've had  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah. Um um  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** all year probably.  
**Alex Schwartz:** looking 18 months out, what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I'm not  
**Alex Schwartz:** Okay.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** sure.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um how are you currently measuring ROI on AI investments?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** No,  
**Alex Schwartz:** Okay.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** no idea.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um, who's ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use at Glue IQ and how does that accountability  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I don't think we have that established.  
**Alex Schwartz:** work?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I think everyone probably has their own personal, you know, criteria for that. I think it'd be an interesting thing like when we have our code of contact pol um like I guess from an HR standpoint like we have our code of contact conduct we have our um policies we have our our um talent playbook I think that's an  
   
 

### 00:27:47

   
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** important thing for us to build into those processes and and and platforms um and our policies I don't think we have any one person accountable  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** but I think we should define what those standards are and what industry standards are and and have it um part of what we we do for our code of  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah, I like that.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** conduct.  
**Alex Schwartz:** I like how I like the idea of fusing those things together. I think that's really good. Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yeah.  
**Alex Schwartz:** what AI tool or initiative did Glue IQ invest in but ultimately abandon and what happened and what did you learn?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I don't know any that we've abandoned.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Okay. Um, if your investors or partners challenged your AI investment tomorrow saying prove this is worth it, what evidence would you show them?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I guess I would show them as I was saying earlier, what I all I can say is based on what I use it for  
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** um is just some of the data and the statistics I've pulled and the research and the insights I've been able to glean from it and how I wo it into strategy like recommendations I've had for our infrastructure.  
   
 

### 00:29:15

   
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** and our processes um and our  
**Alex Schwartz:** Can you give me um a specific example where AI dramatically changed your delivery  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** people.  
**Alex Schwartz:** timeline in terms of what was possible that wasn't before?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I mean absolutely like copywriting and like email responses in summaries and um recommendations. It definitely I don't It cuts my time down dramatically.  
**Alex Schwartz:** It's amazing, isn't it?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** It's  
**Alex Schwartz:** How like amazing. Yeah. Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** amazing.  
**Alex Schwartz:** what's one thing your competitors deliver with AI that Glue IQ can't match yet? And how long until you close the gap?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I'm not sure exactly  
**Alex Schwartz:** Okay. Um, is there a customer problem that Glue IQ could solve with AI that you always assumed was unsolvable?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** customer as in our clients because my like I see our like my customer in my position is like our people and also our  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** executive team. So like I see it differently. So, I don't have that context from like a client standpoint necessarily because I'm not in the day-to-day,  
   
 

### 00:30:38

   
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** but um  
**Alex Schwartz:** frame it internally if if there's a way that you think it could do something that  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** asking a question one more  
**Alex Schwartz:** Sure. Um,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** time.  
**Alex Schwartz:** what customer problem could Glue IQ solve with AI that you always assumed was unsolvable?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I don't know if unsolvable. I just think it's solvable with a lot of time and effort and resources. Um I wouldn't say like it just wasn't unsolvable but just for example how I was saying  
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** um taking information taking data taking recommendations and visualizing it making it something tangible and something that would resonate. So maybe there's like internal I like for example I spent hours and hours I mean weeks probably when three years ago when I made our internal talent playbook. It was like our glue IQ bible and had all of our processes and all of our story about glue and all of our team and um brand um guidelines and how to submit a time card and like I mean like everything you can imagine if I had had access to and knew how to use AI at that time it would have completely changed one it would probably it would be a better deliverable than what it does and the amount of time I invested of it would be you know a fraction of it.  
   
 

### 00:32:04

   
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** So I think it's just taking information and visualizing it making packaging it in a way that resonates and is effective.  
**Alex Schwartz:** That's great. I love it. That's really good. Um, we are halfway through.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Yeah.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Uh, so, Unite, what what AI tools do you suspect your employees are using that aren't officially approved and how do you know?  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Well, I know we all we have like a a dashboard for our glue team, our chat GPT. I forget exactly what it's called,  
**Alex Schwartz:** Mhm.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** but we have our company sponsored one. Um, I mean, I know people use Otter and I forget what the other one's called, but I don't think that's like a glue approved item. I think people use Notion because I've received notion recaps before and they're not part of the  
**Alex Schwartz:** Yeah.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** company, but I I don't I'm not sure.  
**Alex Schwartz:** No, that's good. That's great. That's those are I mean those are clear and tangible things. So that's awesome.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I need to drop in like one minute and leave to get my  
   
 

### 00:33:07

   
**Alex Schwartz:** Um okay.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** kids.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Um can we grab any anything at all for 30 minutes on Thursday or Friday? It might be open for you.  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** I have off on Friday and then Thursday I have like my kids like holiday performances and it's just a crazy time.  
**Alex Schwartz:** Uh yeah, I got my kid doing a holiday thing,  
**Michele Conigliaro-Lenahan:** Um,

Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy) [Recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pmfi5vR9Xluaf4tytL_dw-yIPPsCT6EG/view?usp=drive_web) 

### Summary

m and Alex Schwartz discussed integrating AI tools into Glue IQ's routine to normalize their use, with m suggesting that leadership frequently utilizing the tools would reduce resistance. Alex Schwartz inquired about the approval process for using client data with AI tools, but m was unsure of the existence of such a process, and m also could not identify Glue IQ's top AI-advanced competitors or their concerning actions. Both agreed that the uniquely human value Glue IQ brings is relationship building, which Alex Schwartz called a "human superpower," and m attributed the barrier to Glue IQ's AI transformation to a universal issue of overwhelm and foot-dragging due to the daunting task of learning new technology, a point Alex Schwartz supported. Alex Schwartz confirmed that Human Glue is separate from Glue IQ, with Gaston as an advisor, and Human Glue seeks to integrate their solution under the Glue IQ umbrella through a business pilot and go-to-market playbooks, and Alex Schwartz summarized m's most crucial 90-day focus for Glue IQ's AI transformation as complete adoption and communication.

### Details

*Notes Length: Standard*

* **AI Tool Integration and Adoption** m suggested that integrating AI tools into routine meetings, such as the bi-weekly team meeting, and providing meeting notes generated by these tools could normalize their use. They believed that having leadership use the tools frequently and exposing teams to them naturally, rather than explicitly calling it out, would help reduce resistance and increase comfort with AI ([00:07:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.jjutddqw375)).

* **Client Data and Competitor Analysis** Alex Schwartz asked about the approval process for employees using client data with AI tools, but m did not know if a process existed. m was unable to name the three most AI-advanced competitors or specify what they were doing that concerned them ([00:07:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.jjutddqw375)).

* **Disruptive AI Development and Response** Alex Schwartz presented a hypothetical scenario where a competitor launched an AI service that delivered Glue IQ's core offering faster and cheaper ([00:08:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.iiydgrgjjtm6)). m admitted to not knowing how Glue IQ would respond, but speculated that Gaston would lead the response quickly and directly ([00:10:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.ge6j4l10x9zn)). They identified that automating production work with AI, which would free up time for strategic thinking and relationship building, would be very disruptive for Glue IQ ([00:08:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.iiydgrgjjtm6)).

* **Uniquely Human Value in the Age of AI** m emphasized that as AI handles more analytical and routine tasks, the uniquely human value Glue IQ brings is relationship building, which they noted is crucial for business and fostering forgiveness for mistakes ([00:10:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.ge6j4l10x9zn)). They also mentioned that alleviating mundane tasks for project managers or account personnel allows them to be more proactive and focus on bigger-picture business strategy, further supporting relationships and building trust. Alex Schwartz agreed with the assessment, calling relationship building a "human superpower" in the age of AI ([00:11:56](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.iufqykz6bamo)).

* **Glue IQ's AI Standing and Transformation Barriers** m could not name a specific AI capability or use case where they felt Glue IQ was genuinely ahead of the market. Regarding the "uncomfortable truth" about Glue IQ's AI transformation, m suggested it is a universal issue where people are dragging their feet due to the daunting nature of learning and integrating new technology ([00:12:56](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.gshin9mly96v)). Alex Schwartz agreed that the sense of overwhelm from the speed of change and the challenge of onboarding and upskilling is a significant barrier to AI adoption ([00:14:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.86ej37f6sl5r)).

* **Human Glue and Glue IQ Relationship** Alex Schwartz confirmed that their company, Human Glue, is an entity separate from Glue IQ, although Gaston is an advisor to Human Glue. Human Glue is seeking ways to integrate their solution under the Glue IQ umbrella, with a focus on creating go-to-market playbooks and potentially a joint venture, aiming for mutually beneficial outcomes through a business pilot ([00:15:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.23knv0vjrsri)). m found the business context for the connection between the names "Glue" helpful ([00:18:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.siiiozph0xws)).

* **Short-Term AI Transformation Focus** Alex Schwartz asked what single thing, if not addressed in the next 90 days, could derail Glue IQ's AI transformation. m stated that achieving "complete adoption and awareness" is the most crucial first step, which Alex Schwartz summarized as adoption and communication ([00:18:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.siiiozph0xws)).

* **Surprises from the Interviews** m expressed surprise at the lack of context initially provided for the interviews. They also realized from the discussions the deeper level of seriousness and investment that Gaston has in making Glue IQ an AI leader, evidenced by their commitment to working with Alex Schwartz and having the leadership team participate in the interviews ([00:19:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.424xu68nm9yi)).

* **Automation of Scheduling** Alex Schwartz mentioned they are moving their scheduling to an AI calendar assistant to automate and simplify the process of booking meetings, recognizing the significant time individuals spend on this task ([00:20:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.bb49tgmjjv7)). Alex Schwartz noted that all the interview input will be aggregated anonymously, and a workshop will likely follow to establish a clear path forward for Glue IQ ([00:20:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqt3FV6Lowq69G2oG93OA2cqM5bW_Vd4hC-2GUuBKr4/edit?tab=t.rpv98vv6fiiy#heading=h.bb49tgmjjv7)).

### Suggested next steps
