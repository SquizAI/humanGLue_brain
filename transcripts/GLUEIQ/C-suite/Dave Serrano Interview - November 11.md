[@0:04](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=4.22) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you hear me?

[@0:06](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=6.14) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Hey, how's it going?

[@0:08](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=8.82) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What's up? How's New York?

[@0:10](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=10.84) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

New York is good. I'm calling in from over by Fulton Street as we speak. No kidding.

[@0:18](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=18.42) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Near the old stegs. Some things don't really change.

[@0:22](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=22.0) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, RBC is at Brookfield, so that's where I am now.

[@0:26](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=26.66) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I have not seen you clean-shaven ever. This is new. That is true.

[@0:32](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=32.44) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

It's about a year old. A year old with the change, but it's time for cleanup. How are you doing?

[@0:42](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=42.52) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm great, man. I'm great. Overall, great. A lot to catch up on, but here's my question. You have only one hour.

[@0:52](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=52.94) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Is that true? Yes, if that. Yeah. All right.

[@0:57](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=57.44) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So we should dive right in, because this is 25... ... ... We can catch up any other time.

[@1:04](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=64.18) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

And we can catch up another time.

[@1:05](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=65.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And only one person has actually been able to finish this in one hour, and that was Maggie.

[@1:09](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=69.6) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

So Maggie's the one to be. All right. She and I are very similar, so probably not.

[@1:19](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=79.96) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So the quick version is this is an assessment between the LT and the employees at GlueIQ that is looking to measure the gap between leadership's vision for AI and the employee's vision for AI.

What does AI maturity look like, upskilling, and ultimately, how can we help the organization come together with a cohesive plan to utilize AI and upskilling more effectively?

So we do have a framework. It's also a Glue framework, G for Grow, L for Leverage, U for Unite.

And I'm going to be taking you through questions that are structured in that. And before we dive into AI specifically, Dave, can you tell me a time when GlueIQ successfully rolled out a new transformation initiative across the organization and what made that adoption work?

[@2:27](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=147.82) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

One that we would use? Something that you did within GlueIQ internally as a transformation initiative.

[@2:37](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=157.62) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, could be tech, could be new way of working, could be, you know, AI, could be a tool, you know, just a transformation initiative that was successful and what made it so.

[@2:54](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=174.16) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

We've rolled out a couple of different things over the last seven years. next years. We're We're We're going going

[@3:03](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=183.78) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And whether they've been successful has been possibly due to having no choice but to use this one, only one thing.

[@3:19](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=199.78) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

So I don't know if that's a measure of success. But actually, in context of AI, I would say Beautiful AI is probably the first tool that we've rolled out that people seem really open to.

And that there's been general, this is okay, versus like some of our other software platforms that we use that people are just like, oh, this thing sucks and we have to use it no matter what.

But Beautiful AI is probably the only one that cuts across disciplines. And for the most part, people are feeling pretty good about it.

[@3:59](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=239.32) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's great. Great. I have heard a bit about that as well, and it seems like your feedback is tracking with everyone else's.

Can you tell me about your own AI use? What AI tools did you use yesterday or this week or last week in your actual work, and specific examples are great.

[@4:30](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=270.22) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I use chat, our enterprise version. I pretty much use it probably every day, and I use it for everything from articulating feedback to transcribing meetings to, like, I need three sentences to add to a scope of work.

[@4:57](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=297.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Like, I use it for basically...

[@5:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=300.5) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

All of everything that one would, well, no, it's not everything that one could use it for. But yeah, basically I use it every day for like, I want to give the proper feedback to a team and like make sure that it's articulate.

Or I use it to record my meetings and just like summarize my meetings and pull out the things that like the clients are asking for.

Or I use it to write my scope of works or to check my scope of works. So I use it pretty much every day for those purposes.

[@5:31](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=331.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Awesome.

[@5:32](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=332.1) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

And then I'm also using, so that's like chat. And then I'll use beautiful AI probably like once a week because I often have presentations that I'm working on.

[@5:44](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=344.76) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If you could have an AI expert sit with you for two hours and teach you just one thing about AI with no one else watching, what would you want to learn?

[@5:55](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=355.82) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah.-huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah.-huh. With nobody else watching, don't think there's anything that I'm, like, embarrassed to, like, say that I don't know how to use on AI.

I mean, I'd be totally fine with anybody seeing anything that I was trying to learn how to do.

[@6:24](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=384.86) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Embarrassment aside or lack of embarrassment aside, if you could have someone sit with you for two hours, teach you anything, what would it be?

[@6:35](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=395.92) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

You know, I don't know if we have this capability through our enterprise solutions, but our clients have the capability of creating agents.

And I'd love to learn more about that. And what does that exactly mean? I mean, my client talks about it.

The RBC client talks about it all the time. And I just, and I haven't said, like, oh, show me what that is.

I haven't said it not out of, like, embarrassment.

[@7:09](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=429.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I have a business partner who's building a lot of agentic tools, and it's pretty mind-boggling when you see people that know how to do that and do it well.

I don't, but as a voyeur who's seen it in action and seen it build, it's kind of crazy to think about where we're going.

[@7:31](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=451.94) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, for sure.

[@7:34](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=454.44) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you tell me about a time AI revealed something that completely surprised you or challenged your assumptions?

[@7:50](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=470.34) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

No, I don't think anything that's challenged my assumptions. I don't think I've assumed much for AI.

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=480.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Compared to other executives you know in similar roles, where would you honestly place your AI fluency? Ahead, behind, or on par?

[@8:10](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=490.86) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

At Glue or in general?

[@8:12](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=492.78) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

In general, against other executives in general in a similar role.

[@8:18](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=498.24) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I would probably say ahead.

[@8:22](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=502.08) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But at Glue, I would say behind. What's the most sophisticated thing you've done with AI, where the result really wowed or impressed you?

[@8:43](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=523.84) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I think it's not so much a wow. Well, I think the taking my words and articulating them in A better way to give feedback, and seeing how that feedback has been received, and how people have been like, wow, that's really good feedback.

I'm like, oh, there you go. So it's a very, I don't know how wow that is. not like I'm creating video out of it that's super cool, like some of the team members are.

But more from like a, like just from the ability to articulate much better is pretty impressive.

[@9:33](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=573.541) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So using it kind of as a, as a coach in some way for important interactions where it can help you sort of reframe feedback or make feedback better.

[@9:47](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=587.481) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. Yep. Cool.

[@9:49](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=589.501) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's very cool. I like that. Um, I've never done that with AI. That's something I will now think about doing.

[@9:56](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=596.441) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, do. In particular, because of the creatives. In particular, with creative teams who are, some of them I don't have the best relationship with, so they are waiting for me to say something that they can jump on.

So doing it in a way where it's taking the emotion out, respecting the work that they're doing, and just really being focused on, like, this doesn't work for this reason.

[@10:28](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=628.481) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If you had to bet your job on one AI-driven innovation for GlueIQ, what would it be and why?

[@10:39](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=639.661) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

What do mean?

[@10:42](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=642.701) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Meaning you had to put your neck on the line and say, this is the thing that we're going to do and go all in on from a tooling perspective, from a way of working perspective, from a business model perspective.

This is our big A.I. bet, and I, Dave Serrano, put my neck out, and I'm...

[@11:04](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=664.501) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I don't think we have anything.

[@11:09](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=669.901) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Oh, I'm not saying... This is... This would be future state.

[@11:17](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=677.601) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Well, but I don't know, because I don't know what... I would have to know what we were proposing for me to say I'd be willing to put my, you know, neck on the line.

Okay, all right.

[@11:33](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=693.381) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I can't do it in the abstract, I guess. Okay. Who are your top three A.I. fluent people in the organization?

By capability, not by title.

[@11:51](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=711.141) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Like, so the ones that probably are mastering A.I.? Mm-hmm.

[@11:56](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=716.201) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

At Glue? Yeah.

[@11:58](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=718.781) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Top three.

[@12:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=720.001) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I would say Gaston, Casey Woods, and third, probably somebody I'm not even thinking of.

[@12:39](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=759.201) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Hey, maybe Noel or Tillis.

[@12:42](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=762.081) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay, cool. Have you gone to any of them for help learning AI at any point?

[@12:49](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=769.401) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I've gone to not for help.

[@12:52](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=772.101) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So for Gaston, well, Gaston for help, guess, yes.

[@12:57](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=777.461) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

And conversations around how... ... ... ... ... To leverage AI? Casey and Noelle, I wouldn't go to them for help for it.

[@13:05](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=785.881) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I would just expect that they could leverage it to get the output that we need. And I feel pretty confident that they know how to do it.

What percentage of people would you say are genuinely AI capable today in the organization?

[@13:27](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=807.201) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Do clue? Is it how I define AI capable?

[@13:35](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=815.581) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yep. Your own definition, percentage, thumb in the air.

[@13:40](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=820.081) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

25%. Okay. That's a lot. 15%. Okay.

[@13:49](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=829.081) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And are you aware of any AI upskilling budget program that's currently in the works? And if so, anything about people, investment, or outcomes that are...

[@14:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=840.001) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

being measured?

[@14:05](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=845.501) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Gaston mentioned productizing something.

[@14:10](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=850.601) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Okay.

[@14:12](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=852.041) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But it was in like brief conversation related to RBC. Got it. Okay. Yeah. Looking 18 months out, what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today?

Or put in other words, what would Sam Altman or another tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit that gap?

[@14:37](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=877.761) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I think we, I think for us, well, for my, the work that I'm doing and for my clients, I think in creative development, because I do a lot of campaign work at Glue, I'm probably like one of the only ones, well, I guess.

Again, I do a lot of the campaign work at Glue. So it's probably the place where we would want to elevate it the most.

[@15:10](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=910.661) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you say a little bit more about that?

[@15:12](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=912.741) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

What that would look like? Yeah, sure. So gone are the days where I would be presenting script on paper to my clients.

And basically showing them what felt like a finished version and eliminating imagination on their part of like, how does this come to life?

[@15:41](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=941.081) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay, that's very cool. I like that.

[@15:43](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=943.401) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Which I think we can get there. Yeah.

[@15:46](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=946.321) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Well. So we just finished the growth segment, which is about individual skill building and confidence development through skills for yourself and for the org.

The leverage stage is about AI tool mastery and value creation, and the first question here is, how are you currently measuring ROI on AI investments?

[@16:12](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=972.441) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I am not.

[@16:15](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=975.541) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. Is there any conversation that you're privy to around how you might think about measuring ROI on AI tools or AI investments vis-a-vis client work?

[@16:31](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=991.801) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

No. Okay. But wait, I'm trying to think of, well, the only conversation that I've had related to ROI on AI investment is the client, from a client perspective, like RBC investment in AI.

[@16:51](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1011.54) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. So conversations that I've had with them, not about Glue's investment in AI. Okay. Bye. Who is ultimately accountable for AI ethics in the org?

[@17:11](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1031.18) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Oh, I don't think we have anybody identified for something like that.

[@17:15](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1035.24) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. That's consistent with what everyone else has said, by the way. It's not a trick question. No, it's not.

There are some questions in here that I have gotten very consistent answers to, but just for conformity, I'm asking them anyway.

Sure. Is there an AI tool or initiative that Glue invested in but ultimately abandoned, and what happened and what did you learn?

[@17:52](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1072.44) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

No, I don't think so. I feel like our foray into AI has been relatively new. Okay.

[@18:02](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1082.42) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If your board investors or partners challenged your AI investment tomorrow saying, prove this is worth it, meaning whatever you're investing in now, what evidence would you show them, and what question would you hope they don't ask?

I don't think we'd be able to show them anything.

[@18:23](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1103.06) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

So I hope they wouldn't ask that question.

[@18:26](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1106.18) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay.

[@18:27](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1107.86) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Well, don't know how you measure, I mean, this might be for another conversation, but, like, if so, and it's very possible that I'm, like, not thinking of some of the AI tools that we've used in the past.

It's possible. And the only ones that, like, the only times where AI has really come to greater awareness is, like, when Gaston was, like, starting today, I need you all to use ChatGPD, right?

Like, and then that was, like, a moment in time where things felt very, like, pre and... And then he was like, I need you all to use Beautiful AI.

So it was like the pre-Beautiful AI and post-Beautiful AI. But before that, I don't know what other investments were being made and how we would have measured the ROI on those.

And even with using the chat enterprise and the Beautiful AI, I don't know how you would measure ROI on that either.

[@19:28](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1168.18) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. That was helpful. That was good. And I like the pre and post-frame on GPT and also on Beautiful.

[@19:41](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1181.18) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Like we've been using it. We've been using AI before that. Like plenty of times I went into meetings and the creative team has shown me design or video that was created in AI.

But that was really more of like a tool that the creative team was using, not something that was broader.

[@20:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1200.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Can you give me a specific example where AI dramatically changed your delivery timeline? What was possible that wasn't before?

[@20:17](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1217.48) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Probably, my most dramatic change in writing Scope of Works, it probably went from like a two to three day dragging it out, like doing it a little bit at a time to like just knocking it out in half.

And like if it takes me a day, it's only because it's taken me like it's only because I can start and stop it, but it's like writing a Scope of Work literally takes me like probably 15 minutes now.

[@20:53](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1253.22) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's amazing.

[@20:54](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1254.66) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah.

[@20:56](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1256.22) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And are you using, this is just my own question. But is it you're using recorded notes from client conversations and then basically just taking all of that in tandem with, like, an RFP and sort of putting it all together in GPT and just parsing it out?

Basically, yeah. Makes sense.

[@21:18](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1278.42) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

If I have the notes from the client meeting, otherwise I'll take, like, you know, an RFP from something that we've just won.

Take that and, like, dump it into chat and, like, it'll give me a scope of work that's pretty consistent with all the scope of works that we've done in the past.

Yeah, like, if you remember, like, wordings of things and it's like, you know, you, whenever you write scope of works, you have to, like, you remember this.

It's like, you bring out all the, like, the big words that you're like, oh, this retainer, blah, and you're like, these are words that you don't use unless you're writing a scope of work.

And it's like, it just takes all that thinking away because you're just like. It gives it to you.

[@22:02](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1322.2) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So speaking of agents, imagine a future where you have an agentic tool that's pre-programmed with a template for the key things to write a scope of work.

You have, you know, Notion or Asana or Slack or whatever equivalent, and it can literally take the notes. You jump off a call with RBC, it pushes that right into the agent, and it starts drafting it in the background.

[@22:33](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1353.68) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

It's like amazing. Yeah, that's your future state. Actually, one of the wows where I was a little bit like, holy , this is pretty cool, was we had a, like, we were doing a celebrity contract for Stellantis.

And I paid, I don't know, nine grand? for this contract to be written. And it took like four weeks.

And they were like, the day before we were going on air, they were like, oh, we have another celebrity that we want to use.

And I was like, oh, , this is going to cost me another $9,000. And I, instead, I just like took my existing contract, dropped it in, put in the new person, put in the terms, and it gave me a new contract, which then was sent to this person.

Like, I was kind of like, we'll see what happens. And it went to this person's management team. And like, we're talking about like a, not like a novice.

We're talking about somebody who's worth millions, whose legal team would scrutinize this. And they were like, yeah, that sounds great.

And I was like, great. I just saved myself $9,000.

[@23:43](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1423.68) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I use it for MSAs. I use it for legal work. It's pretty fantastic. Yeah.

[@23:50](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1430.5) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

And actually, like, even in that contract, like, yeah, maybe that was a wow. The client was like, oh, like, did you not include, I can't even remember.

Remember the term? She used some term that I was like, I don't even know what that means in my head, but I was like, I can't tell her that.

was like, I was like, the use of, it's like for dealers to be able to use the commercial and have the rights to do it, but it's like called something else.

And I literally just like dropped it into chat and it gave me the verbatim and they were like, oh, this is perfect.

Great. Thank you. And I was like, saved days and money. That's great.

[@24:29](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1469.38) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. I want to talk a little bit about competitors in your space. What's one thing competitors deliver with AI that Glue can't match yet and how long until you close that gap?

[@24:45](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1485.16) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Say that again?

[@24:47](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1487.04) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What's one thing your competitors deliver with AI that GlueIQ can't match yet and how long until you close that gap?

and gap is by the Right.

[@24:56](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1496.96) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I be I remember great. Thank According to G, from a creative perspective, what I mentioned earlier, apparently, like, competitors for Stellantis pitches are providing them with, like, ready-to-air video on pitches.

And I don't know how long we are from doing that.

[@25:21](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1521.82) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So using AI tools to create ready-to-air video for pitches?

[@25:26](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1526.18) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yep. Cool.

[@25:28](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1528.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What is a customer problem? Let me say this differently. What customer problem could GlueIQ solve with AI that we've always assumed was unsolvable?

[@25:49](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1549.22) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I don't know if I can just off the top of my head come up with a situation that I find unsolvable.

[@25:59](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1559.4) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And know we're getting with each other. Thank you. Okay. How about a lower order down? How about just, is there something that's been challenging in the past that you think AI could make, a customer problem specifically, that you think AI could help you solve more easily?

[@26:38](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1598.52) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I'm to think of, like, what customer problems we have. Like, is it, like, our customer, like, a problem that we have as an organization, or is it a problem that the clients have that AI could solve for?

[@26:52](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1612.68) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

For the client. Is there a problem that Glue has that we would solve? Uh... Client-related problem that we would solve?

Client-related problem that you would solve with AI, correct.

[@27:16](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1636.52) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I don't know. mean, our clients are, there's so many, they have so many problems. Like, I don't know if, I don't know if the issue for solving them is an AI issue or just a.

[@27:27](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1647.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Just customers have so many problems.

[@27:29](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1649.94) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Just customers have so many problems.

[@27:32](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1652.42) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We can move on.

[@27:34](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1654.36) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

That's good.

[@27:35](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1655.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So the next stage is Unite, which is about social learning and organizational change. First question here is about shadow AI awareness is a question I love.

What AI tools do you suspect your employees are using that aren't officially approved? And how do you know?

[@27:57](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1677.34) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I don't.

[@28:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1680.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Any tools in particular that you think they might be using?

[@28:04](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1684.7) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

That our teams are using? That's not approved?

[@28:07](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1687.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@28:14](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1694.54) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Well, if you're using anything on Google, that's not approved.

[@28:18](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1698.96) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. So that would include anything related to Gemini or Nano Bananas or anything at all within Google's AI suite?

[@28:29](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1709.12) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Correct. Okay.

[@28:32](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1712.66) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's the only platform that Gee has told us he wants us off.

[@28:37](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1717.5) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Okay.

[@28:38](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1718.88) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Data democracy. Who in your organization has access to AI-powered insight?

[@28:47](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1727.1) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I mean, all of us do.

[@28:49](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1729.52) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. That's consistent, by the way.

[@28:52](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1732.2) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Okay.

[@28:57](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1737.58) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Natural adoption... adoption... Pre-requisites. Name the top three specific changes that are needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced at GlueIQ.

[@29:21](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1761.26) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Time. I think time.

[@29:31](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1771.36) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay.

[@29:36](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1776.62) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

And then one more time, three.

[@29:39](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1779.06) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Three changes needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced.

[@29:53](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1793.12) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

So I think it's, yes, it's time to learn it. Opportunity to practice it, some more practice. And then just more time.

[@30:09](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1809.04) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

When time, you mean blocking dedicated time. So the organization would say, hey, in your day, we're going to get this is, we know you have all these things to do, but we're going to carve out specific.

[@30:20](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1820.96) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, but that's like, that's the opposite of what I would want, because it's unrealistic. So, like, we literally just had this conversation where, like, Joey was like, Joey and Gaston went on this whole thing about AI, and they were like, and we're going to create these videos, and we're going to do this, and we're going to do that.

And I want to be like, I'm so glad that you have the time to be able to do that.

Like, I don't have time to be practicing and creating these fun things. Like, I'm, like, in the weeds.

[@30:56](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1856.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So, and so is everybody else.

[@31:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1860.0) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

So when would you like to do this? So, but on the flip side of it, it's like, I don't want somebody to tell me to take three hours of my day because I don't have three hours to do it.

I just like, when I talk about time, it's like, maybe it's like, don't think I'm going to do this or anybody else is going to do this right now because you've told us to do it right now.

Like, but anticipate that this is going to be like, that you should check in three months from now. And if in three months from now, you're not seeing the adoption or the usage or the expertise that you think that we should have, then that's a different story.

But like, don't, you can't just turn it on and expect everybody to be like, okay, ready to go, ready to roll.

So time from like a, I don't need you to tell me to lock off three hours of my day to do it.

It's just more time of like, introduce this and leave me alone for. A quarter.

[@32:02](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1922.84) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And let me figure it out. Okay.

[@32:09](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1929.48) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I think the practice piece is also like, the expectation is sort of like, here's a tool, go do this now, and do this for your client meetings, versus like, encouraging using it in internal conversations.

So, like, that's something that we don't really talk about a lot. Like, we use Beautiful AI, and it's always for the client presentation, and it's always like, getting ready for client presentations.

But it's like, we should encourage people to do it for the simplest of like, for any type of client briefing, for like, our Glue University.

Like, we should encourage people using it to practice run, so that people learn how to use it more, like, to become better at it.

So I think time, practice, and like, more time.

[@33:03](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=1983.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Sidebar with you, how would you want to learn AI more fluidly? Would you want, and I'll give you some examples, would you want a place to go and watch videos or YouTube and somebody kind of curates it for you and they say, hey, hey, Dave, based on what you do day to day, here's 10 tools that could be beneficial to you.

These top three are your workhorses. These are the use cases that would impact you most. Here's where to go find that.

Here's the odds and ends that can fill in here and there. Do these in your spare time, but focus on these workhorses and it will unlock XYZ for you in terms of value for yourself and for your clients.

That would be one approach. Another approach would be, hey. We're going to get you and a few other folks like you that are on accounts to do a cohort-based learning.

We're all going to learn this stuff together, and then we're going to have, you know, a weekly sync where we're going to share kind of what we learned, you know, peer-to-peer learning.

Hey, I unlocked this. Hey, I did this. Hey, look at this. This is a cool new hack. Would you want some sort of bot or behavioral coach to be checking in and kind of giving you an IEP and weekly saying, hey, did you spend 15 minutes this week doing XYZ?

Like, what would the learning format and the accountability look like for you in a way that felt like it was complementary and useful and not like you were being forced?

[@34:56](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2096.0) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I think any type of weekly, like, now... We're going to have these meetings is putting me in the forced category.

Yeah.

[@35:05](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2105.92) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@35:09](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2109.12) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Because I don't want any more meetings. We already have too many meetings, internal meetings. And I'm not a fan, necessarily.

I've yet to see an internal meeting where we're supposed to learn off of one another, where we actually are, and it doesn't get hijacked by a specific agenda.

But also, I'm not sure, because also I'm much more senior than a lot of people from an experience perspective.

So I have to try to figure out, take my own self out of it, because it's not about what's going to help Dave Serrano.

I have to think about, like, what's going to help the mid-level career people who are less tired and less.

Less cranky about another meeting on their calendar. know, it's like, I have to think about that because I generally go into, you're not surprised, I generally go into it very skeptical and very sort of like, well, this is like another meeting and it's not going to, we're not going to accomplish anything.

I think like, you know, Maggie could say the same thing, but it's also because we're coming at it from the perspective of like, enough already, we've done this so much.

Like I'm not going to learn from like someone who has 15 years less experience, but if I flip it, I have to think about like how they're going to learn and, and how it's going to help them.

So I don't really have an answer for this one besides like, I don't want anybody telling me that I have to have a meeting and talk about it.

And I don't want anybody telling me that I have to like do homework and I certainly don't want to do it on my off time.

[@36:53](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2213.6) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah.

[@36:55](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2215.5) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Well, so that was like a non-answer, but.

[@36:59](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2219.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, it's, but. It's about preferences, which is an answer, right? You're articulating your preferences, which I think is important.

You're also talking about where you personally find friction and where it would feel forced for you. So I think that's valuable.

[@37:14](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2234.86) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

it's a little bit of a back and forth because on one hand, like, I am very much like a hands-on keyboard learning learner.

So, like, I do have to practice this to learn it, and, like, and you convert me once I start using it.

And practicing it, like, you know, so it's like, it's just a matter of being able to do that. It's like, what does it take to get somebody to just incorporate this more often into their world and into their day?

Like, the same that I've done with chat. Like, you know, it's like, I use it all day long. And it's kind of like, why wouldn't I use it all day long?

[@37:53](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2273.34) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. And the value is clear, and the incentive to practice is clear.

[@37:57](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2277.94) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

And it's the most big. It's basic entry point to A.I. It's literally chat. It's the most basic way of getting into A.I.

and it's the most simplistic thing that A.I. could possibly do. I'm not a hero for using it, but it's shocking if somebody else isn't using it.

[@38:18](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2298.02) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And like I said, think 75% of Glue is not using it, if not 85%. This is very helpful. Thank you.

Okay. The Evolve Stage, which is about strategic vision and thought leadership. The first question is about your competitive A.I.

reality. Can you name your three most A.I. competitors? What specifically are they doing that concerns you?

[@38:56](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2336.78) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I don't know if I probably could. Didn't answer who our most advanced competitors are, I would imagine, I mean, it also depends on like the category that I'm thinking and like the vertical that I'm thinking about.

Yeah, I don't know if I can answer this one.

[@39:27](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2367.62) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay.

[@39:29](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2369.42) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

It's probably somebody that I would not have thought of in a million years. Like, I don't think that, well, I can't say I guarantee.

I bet you like the, I don't even know the name of half these companies anymore, like the publicists of the world.

Like, I'm sure they talk a big talk on AI, but I'm skeptical on like how they're putting it into practice.

[@39:52](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2392.36) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And it's probably not a publicist who I should be worried about.

[@39:55](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2395.1) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

It's probably a Glue-like object that I haven't thought of. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

[@40:04](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2404.12) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If we surveyed your clients about whether you're an AI leader or laggard compared to other agencies, what would they honestly say?

[@40:14](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2414.18) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Perception-wise, they would say we were a leader.

[@40:19](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2419.88) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What evidence shapes that view?

[@40:25](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2425.22) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

They would, I would think that my clients would all, the way that we talk about it, or the way that we, I think that what we do at Glue is like we talk about it in a way where it's not like this like shiny new thing, like it's just part of the everyday.

And our confidence when it comes to sort of being more digitally technically advanced. It parlays itself into confidence that we are leaders in it, whether it's true or not.

[@41:09](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2469.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's great. That's a really good answer. Thank you. Thank you. What AI development in the next 18 months could fundamentally disrupt your business model?

For example, if a competitor launched an AI service tomorrow that made your core offering 50% faster and 30% cheaper, how quickly could you respond?

[@41:33](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2493.52) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I think it would be really hard. I think if the AI technology, for example, in so many different ways, if the technology, for one example, of creating video became accessible, like greater accessible, and became like, you know, our...

Client could be like, here's what I need a script for. That would completely eliminate the need for us to be able to write, like writing scripts and creating videos for them anymore.

That's like one small thing. Well, it's not a small thing. That would be one big thing. If our client suddenly was like, I don't need you guys creating these dashboards that, you know, these performance dashboards that are pulling all of my analytics from a sales perspective, from a media perspective, from a, like, if suddenly the clients were like, we have a tool that could do that without you guys, like, that would be another blow to us.

If we had a client that, I mean, all of this, I feel like exists already. So, like, we're all, like, we're on the verge of being screwed.

Like, if there was a tool that our clients would turn to and be like, AI is solving my media planning problems.

Like, you know, I'm going to tell this tool that I have $5 million spend here on my media objectives, and it shoots out a media plan, and it, like, and then it connects to the Googles and the Emacs of the world.

Like, we're also, like, okay, goodbye, Glue. It like, you don't need us to do that anymore. Like, I kind of feel like a lot of, most of everything that what we do from a service perspective can be, like, AI can be doing it.

[@43:29](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2609.43) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So you see disruption from AI in a very clear lens, and I guess what would block you from learning how to harness some of those same AI disruptions and make them a benefit instead of a threat?

[@43:47](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2627.43) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Well, see, that's, like, yeah, so that's a good question, because that's all this, that's, the struggle is, how do you find, I hate saying how do you find a time, right?

All All right. If it matters, you find the time. But how do you find the time or the resources or the ability to be able to run your day-to-day work, and maybe it's not any of us, maybe it's like somebody else, while identifying how we're going to solve for when AI comes for our jobs from video development perspective, or when AI comes for us from a performance media perspective.

So it's like somebody's got to be thinking about that, but not all of us can be doing that.

[@44:36](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2676.29) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We just can't.

[@44:38](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2678.25) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I can't. When am I going to do that? Which is kind of a, I would never say that to Gaston, because I feel like in my mind, I'm like, okay, I'll do it at midnight.

But I'm like 50\. I don't want to be doing that at midnight. I'm going to sleep.

[@44:52](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2692.73) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm yeah, I'm tired. The reason I was also...

[@45:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2700.0) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I'm able to just sort of answer that one, I think, a little bit quicker, too, because my client and I were having that exact conversation today, that AI is essentially, all these tools that are being introduced are essentially doing the jobs that people were doing forever.

And one by one, we're seeing all of these jobs replaced by, not replaced, all of these jobs accomplished by AI.

So it's like, how do you figure out how to use, like, what our role is? I don't know how to figure that out just yet.

No. Oh, we froze. You can use AI to fill in the gap or whatever I said.

[@45:43](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2743.41) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Human value. As AI handles more analytical and routine work, what uniquely human value does GlueIQ bring that becomes more important, and how are you doubling down on it?

[@46:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2760.01) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I think the transparency in how we're guiding our clients through these conversations is probably the best thing that we can do right now, or how we're doing it.

[@46:20](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2780.95) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I like that. Last question of this section, then we'll have three quick questions to wrap up. Can you name one specific AI capability where GlueIQ is ahead of the market?

[@46:36](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2796.27) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

No. Okay.

[@46:39](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2799.84) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So, wrapping up, three final questions. No, because I don't think we're doing anything ahead of the market. Yes. No, I follow.

Yeah. Okay. First question, what's the uncomfortable truth about GlueIQ's AI transformation that everyone knows, but no one says out loud?

[@47:04](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2824.39) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

That the majority of us are not tapping into any of it, even in the most simplistic form.

[@47:15](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2835.33) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Second, what's the one thing that if we don't address in the next 90 days could derail GlueIQ's AI transformation?

[@47:27](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2847.65) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I think being honest about how we're using it and why it matters to not just be like... I had a colleague who the other day was like, I can't figure out beautiful AI, I'm going to send this to you in share slides.

And that ability to just sort of dismiss it so quickly is returning to a behavior of like, I don't have to adopt it, I'm going to find a solution around it.

So it's either we do it or we...

[@48:02](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2882.05) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I've been using Gamma myself, and I've been doing, I started doing this AI bootcamp for Florida Atlantic University, and I'm working with two folks who are pretty proficient with AI, and I built a few presentations with Gamma, and I got very frustrated because I couldn't do it in my brand style and choose my images, the format wasn't great, it wasn't taking my new fonts.

I didn't like the layouts, and I've defaulted back to PowerPoint, and I feel that friction. I literally feel it.

And so I'm using AI to grade my homework and talk about the flow and the content. I'm using AI to improve my thinking.

I'm using AI to create images in a lot of different areas, but that act of using an AI presentation tool.

I found a lot of friction.

[@49:02](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=2942.07) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

So me too. I was doing it once for a brief. And what sort of broke through, and by far I'm not an expert.

There's a part of me that's just sort of accepted what it is, what it is, and I work within my limitations.

But I was very close to the point where I was like, I can't do this anymore because it's not letting me center a word.

And I want to center a word, right? So the thing that got me over the hump on it was I was having a conversation with guests.

I happened to get on a call with G about it. But not about the presentation. That would be crazy to call him about complaining about a presentation.

But we were talking about something, and the presentation came up. And I was like, oh, I can't even center this stupid headline.

And it was almost like therapy. was like, Dave, he's like, oh, he's like, listen. He's like... You're using it like PowerPoint.

Take that out of your head. Don't, like the way that you used to combine things and do this, that's not how this works.

What this is doing is ensuring that you're working off of a template that you picked. So the template is never going to let you modify it because that's the whole point.

Like it's trying to make things easier by keeping you within the template. So if you're forcing the template to change, he's like, yes, there's ways that you could do it, but that's not the point.

So it was kind of like that conversation that I had with Gaston where he like gave me a little bit of therapy on like, stop looking at it from this perspective.

And all it took was like a five-minute chat. I then, from then on, I either picked a template that worked for me or when I couldn't move something because it gave me so much anxiety that it wasn't left justified.

I just accepted it for what it was. And then, and by accepting. For what it was, I was like, okay, like, this works now.

Like, if I don't, if I don't have to, you know, footnotes always go on the bottom left. And I was working in a template that just wouldn't let me do that.

And it's like, okay, well, the footnote goes on the top, like, who's going to say anything about that?

[@51:16](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3076.69) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Nobody, nobody, nobody's going to be like, whoa, why do you have an asterisk on the top of your slide?

Yep, that's right.

[@51:22](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3082.49) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

So that type of therapy almost was like the breakthrough on, or like that type of vulnerability in front of somebody who's like very senior and like who I would expect that he would expect that I know how to do this, got me over the hump of switching back to PowerPoint.

So maybe that's like, you asked a question earlier, like maybe that's like one of the things that's like, you know, it's like being vulnerable and exposing yourself for not knowing how to do something and letting somebody teach you.

[@52:00](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3120.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. That's a big part of it. And I think the other thing that you said that's impactful is letting go of what the tool you used before did versus what this tool does now in order to move faster.

[@52:22](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3142.41) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Yep. Yeah.

[@52:25](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3145.03) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Last question. What surprised you most about our conversation today?

[@52:47](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3167.13) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

I'm not sure anything caused, like, she had mentioned something that led me to believe that, like, you're... I think I said this earlier, that he's looking to productize AI somehow.

And we talk about that all the time, productizing things, and I'm always like, I don't know what that means, but when you got it, let me know, and I'm all ears.

So I don't think anything in the line of questioning was surprising, or your approach was surprising. So I don't know, like, I think that, like, some of your, I think that, based on some of your questions, G might be surprised on the answers, that, like, we're not as far as we think we are.

[@53:44](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3224.93) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. By the way, all of this is going to be anonymized.

[@53:48](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3228.91) \- **David Serrano (GlueIQ)**

Sure. But I mean, I would tell him. Yeah. I don't think I said anything that he would be like, what the hell.

I think, um...

[@54:02](https://fathom.video/share/m3Z5QaiYU9i6bPusDPQETgy1-UApHguR?timestamp=3242.27) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Here, can end the recording here. Hold on one second.
