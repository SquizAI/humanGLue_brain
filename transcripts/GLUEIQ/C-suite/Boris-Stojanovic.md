[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=0.0) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Hey, man. Hey, Boris. How are you? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm good. I'm good.

[@0:06](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=6.2) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

I'm good. You having a good week? It's getting there. Got some time off coming up, I hope. A little break?

I will see.

[@0:16](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=16.62) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Yeah.

[@0:18](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=18.74) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Yeah. Well, listen, I know you've been super busy, and I know you're handling all things consulting and leading that, so I can't imagine that's a forgiving schedule.

So I appreciate you making the time.

[@0:33](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=33.5) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Well, thank you for just... Go ahead. No, thank you for just back and forth. It's been naughty a little bit with timing, but yep, let's jump into it.

Fantastic. All right.

[@0:51](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=51.36) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

So are you familiar a little bit with what we're doing? Nope.

[@0:56](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=56.3) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Okay.

[@0:58](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=58.74) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

So my company... HumanGlue, which is independent of GlueIQ, is partnering with you guys to run a pilot across AI maturity and upskilling.

And we are also exploring with G where there may be some opportunities to go to market with you. So behind me, I've got a couple folks that are ridiculously talented in the AI space.

My background, as you may know, is I ran the Disrupted Workforce Thought Leadership and podcast for a while, which was all about the future of work with a double click on how AI is disrupting businesses and individual skills.

And for HumanGlue, what we're starting with with you guys is something we're calling the Reality Gap Assessment. So it is measuring the delta between the leadership and the employee base in terms of where your vision is, as opposed to kind of employee reality.

And how do we identify opportunities to upskill and move faster, think about ROI, think about, you know, where to invest in AI upskilling, where are the opportunities for GlueIQ organizationally, all those sorts of things.

And we use the Glue transformation model. G is for grow, which is individual skill building and confidence development. L is for leverage, AI tools, mastery, and value creation.

U for unite, how do we unite around social learning and organizational change. And E is evolve, which is ongoing development and thought leadership.

So it's about 25 questions across these dimensions. And it helps us understand, you know, where you guys sit in your AI transformation journey across the Glue framework.

And I'm really interested in hearing your candid perspectives on what's working, what's not, where you see gaps. No wrong answers.

The value comes from, as I said, comparing leadership and employee. perspectives to unlock opportunities. And it's important to note everything we discuss is confidential for us.

So we'll be aggregating all of the insights, and it's not about evaluating individuals. So it's about pulling together a cohesive view of where things are in the ELT and then where things are across the employee base.

So the first question I have is before we dive into AI specifically, can you tell me about a time where GlueIQ successfully rolled out a transformation initiative across the organization?

Could be anything. Could be AI, could be project management, new way of working, a new initiative, anything that you would consider transformation across the organization, and what made that adoption work or not work?

Trying to kind of understand how those things happen culturally and within two years ago when we

[@4:00](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=240.0) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

We moved to a new time tracking, invoices, and everything platform called Productive.

[@4:17](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=257.48) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

What can you tell me about that? How did it go?

[@4:21](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=261.02) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

It was the old one was not really built for what we are trying to do, and we were trying to force use of a wrong tool, and then when we switched it, it was way easier to adopt it.

So the other one was just the wrong fit, and this one better fits what we need.

[@4:46](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=286.92) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Great. And did it go well? Did it go smoothly? Any lessons learned from how that was implemented? It went well.

I think it went well.

[@4:54](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=294.2) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I think everybody was happy to move to a better platform. Awesome.

[@5:00](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=300.0) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Okay. Diving into AI, what AI tools did you use yesterday or this week in your actual work?

[@5:14](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=314.4) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I use... ChadGPT, Claude, and I didn't use Perplexity. Okay.

[@5:29](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=329.0) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Claude, the regular version? ClaudeCode? Regular version.

[@5:34](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=334.66) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Okay.

[@5:35](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=335.26) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Awesome. And what would you say is the most sophisticated thing you've done with AI that actually surprised you with the results?

[@5:44](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=344.08) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I played with N8N, and I was able to connect a couple of different... things and to get it to work.

Fantastic.

[@6:05](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=365.06) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Very cool. If you could have an AI expert sit with you for two hours and teach you one thing about AI with no one else watching, what would you want to learn?

[@6:22](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=382.48) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I think something like that, like a deeper knowledge of a true agentic workflow, like hands-on, because in theory, I know what it is, but I think hands-on.

[@6:37](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=397.1) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And what would you want the outcome to be in terms of what you'd be able to do, you know, next that you can't do now?

[@6:48](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=408.92) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I have a couple ideas that I think I would like it to do. Okay, great.

[@6:58](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=418.26) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Compared to other executives, You know, in similar roles to your own, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency?

Ahead, behind, or on par?

[@7:10](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=430.38) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

In the company or outside?

[@7:13](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=433.76) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Holistically, when you think about other folks in a role like yours at other companies, where would you place yourself?

Ahead, behind, or on par?

[@7:25](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=445.32) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I think I'm behind. I don't think it's ever... I mean, I sell AI workflows, but I don't think my knowledge is where it needs to be to fully talk about it.

I think it's one of those things that that's why I was tinkering with, and in order to better understand...

And now with skills and ever-changing, and then talking to a few other companies, it's like there's different levels of how deep you go, but I don't think that's easily achievable.

[@8:16](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=496.361) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

I appreciate the candor. I really do. really do. This is an interesting question. If you had to bet your job on one AI-driven innovation for GlueIQ, what would it be and why?

[@8:33](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=513.281) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Workflow. Ah, how come?

[@8:37](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=517.221) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Authentic workflow.

[@8:41](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=521.241) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Because it can help us internally and reduce 50% of the staff, and that's what 9 out of 10 clients want to talk about.

[@8:57](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=537.881) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And what would have to be... Who are your top three AI fluent people in the organization? Not by title, just by actual capability and skills.

[@9:30](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=570.98) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I would say Gaston, since he met you guys, I think he sees some of the things that other people don't, and then Matt on the technical side.

Because we are both involved in a very technical project with AI.

[@9:57](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=597.8) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And he's the...

[@9:59](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=599.14) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

He's the... He sees the code. And if you had to pick a third? Third, maybe hands-on. And I'm talking about people that can mess with it, they can do things with it, not just use it for emails, images, and, you know, creative work.

There's this guy, Mike, who's, like, on the tech side. Okay.

[@10:29](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=629.261) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

What's his last name, just so I know?

[@10:31](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=631.361) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Arius.

[@10:32](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=632.601) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Okay, great. And have you gone to any of those guys for help to learn AI better?

[@10:37](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=637.841) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Every day.

[@10:39](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=639.281) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Yeah. Yeah.

[@10:41](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=641.121) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I mean, I talk to them about it, and they have opinions that, and they have knowledge. Like, I like exchanging knowledge with them.

[@10:55](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=655.141) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

That's great. What percentage of your people... balls. Would you say are genuinely AI capable today?

[@11:04](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=664.201) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Define capable because, again, there is capable of creating a Gentic workflow and there is capable of I created a video or an image.

[@11:15](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=675.961) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Let's say capable could be knowing the difference between, you know, prompt engineering and context engineering.

[@11:28](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=688.061) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I think a very small number of people within our organization. Yeah.

[@11:34](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=694.981) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Do you have an AI upskilling budget program and any participation in that presently?

[@11:45](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=705.121) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Define that.

[@11:46](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=706.181) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

So it would be a formal program where people are being regularly given kind of these are the tools. That we want you to use.

These are the metrics that we're looking at.

[@12:05](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=725.061) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

We are just starting one of the retainers that we just signed will have that element of it. Got it.

Until now, no.

[@12:21](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=741.601) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

If you were to look 18 months out, what AI capabilities will GlueIQ need that you definitely don't have today?

[@12:31](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=751.901) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

A genetic workflow.

[@12:33](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=753.961) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And a follow-up would be, thinking even more broadly, what would Sam Altman or another tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit the gap?

[@12:49](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=769.581) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I think that there is a big, big opportunity with all the small shops that they're popping up with. Not specialized services and specialized things that they do, but I think that somebody somewhere is working on AI marketing agencies end-to-end as a genetic workflow, and they're going to kill it.

And also, I think that agencies are going to just start to fire people. From what I'm seeing, it's a very, very, on both agency side and the client side, they're starting to understand what they need to do in order to do that.

So I think lots of people jump into it without really understanding. What's at what and how do you need to do AI?

And now they're slowly figuring it out. And I think once that becomes mainstream, it's going to be interesting.

[@14:20](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=860.482) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

I agree with you. I really do. How are you guys currently measuring ROI on AI investments?

[@14:29](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=869.122) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

We don't.

[@14:30](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=870.002) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Okay. Who's ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use at GlueIQ?

[@14:40](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=880.602) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Gaston.

[@14:42](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=882.342) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And how does that accountability work day to day? I don't think it doesn't.

[@14:49](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=889.142) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Not yet, right? Did say? Yeah, not yet.

[@14:54](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=894.222) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

What AI tool or initiative did GlueIQ invest in, but ultimately... which Thank

[@15:03](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=903.762) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I don't think we invested in anything.

[@15:07](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=907.222) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

So I haven't invested in anything yet that you've said, hey, this isn't working, we're walking away, and here's why.

No, not like AI.

[@15:17](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=917.462) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

No.

[@15:19](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=919.622) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

If you're investors or partners, well, I guess you're all partners. So I'll say, if your investors or anyone outside the organization that has a vested interest in GlueIQ challenge your AI investment tomorrow, saying prove this is worth it, what evidence would you show them?

[@15:44](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=944.942) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

There is no evidence because we didn't invest in anything.

[@15:51](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=951.402) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Can you give me a specific example where AI dramatically changed your delivery timeline? What was possible that wasn't?

[@16:01](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=961.082) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Building consulting techs in a matter of days, which would take three months. Yeah.

[@16:09](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=969.462) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And is this an exception or is it becoming the norm now?

[@16:13](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=973.862) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

It's a norm.

[@16:15](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=975.262) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

That's great. Yeah. This is similar to what you were saying about agentic workflows, but you may have a different answer.

But more broadly, what's one thing your competitors will deliver with AI that you can't match yet?

[@16:41](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1001.42) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Scale.

[@16:44](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1004.48) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And how long do you estimate it'll take to close that gap?

[@16:48](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1008.92) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I don't think we ever will know, nor it makes sense for us to try.

[@16:55](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1015.8) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Can you say a little bit more about that? Well, Let's Let's go.

[@16:59](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1019.66) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

go. go. I think that big agencies are going at the scale of this, meaning that they're testing, that they're trying to invest a ton of money into solutions that I'm not sure are the right investments.

So their ability to scale and to invest is way higher than what we can do. Our approach needs to be focused and precise on what we feel is the right thing to put in the market.

While, you know, Publicis or any of the bigger holding companies, they're going at it from every single angle because they can.

And because that's the only way for them to grow, for us, that's not really the case. We need to pick and focus on a very specific area that we can be with who we are and what we offer one of the best in the market.

So we should never try to just try everything and scale and do so many things at the same time.

We should really focus on what we think is the right thing and where we are already having successful conversation with the C-suite.

[@18:35](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1115.08) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Makes sense. Very good answer. What customer problem could GlueIQ solve with AI that you've always assumed was unsolvable?

[@18:52](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1132.0) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I don't know what's unsolvable, but what we need to solve is what's... What's the future of marketing internally and with agencies?

I think that, again, big agencies, holding companies, they have issue with that because it automatically crushes their business on a much bigger scale than we'll ever see.

For us to adjust and to shift and that's why hyper-focus on the areas that we feel will make a change can just bring us more than for them because they can only go up and everything that is happening right now in the industry, I don't think they can go up.

They will go down and down and down just because they monopolize advertising or marketing or whatever you want to call that.

Yeah. So for them to go in and to say, you know, your old agency that was charging you $100 million, we can do that for 20?

They can't do that because they were the one charging $100 million. So it's very, very, I think that there is opportunity for us to really do that well.

But you need to bring tools, you need to bring know-how, and you need to bring ability to deliver in a way that even from what I'm seeing, IBM's and some of the usual suspects in marketing can.

Not. And just because of their scale. Yeah.

[@21:05](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1265.9) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And what makes AI the key to solving that now? Just because it's doable.

[@21:14](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1274.74) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Before you needed to have army of people plus proprietary technology plus plus now that becomes very attainable. And again, it's the time and the place where we are in comparison to holding companies.

What AI tools do you suspect your employees are using that aren't officially approved? And how do you know? Everything.

[@21:48](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1308.12) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Except ChatGPT, which we have enterprise license.

[@21:55](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1315.6) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

So are they, are they, is there a do not use? Or is it just understood that, hey, folks are using AI, it's good.

Whether they're approved or not, it's good because we want them experimenting. We want them using the tool.

[@22:12](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1332.5) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I mean, they're experimenting as long as you're not, you know, uploading clients' documents and sharing with the world. I think, especially on the creative side, they should be using everything and anything to increase productivity and get us and produce more.

Yeah.

[@22:35](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1355.62) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Now, who in your organization has access to AI-powered insights? AI-powered for what? So, specifically, internal customer data, just are the insights that are being generated?

That, you know, perhaps are being shared across the LT, for example, that leverage AI. Are those being shared company-wide?

Are there any restrictions in terms of who can see what? This question is really around kind of AI analytics internal.

I don't think we do it good enough.

[@23:23](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1403.28) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I think we're just starting with ChatGPT, where we are localizing some of those things, but we haven't started doing that the right way.

Yeah. And being disciplined how you do it.

[@23:43](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1423.04) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Tell me the top three specific changes needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced at GlueIQ.

[@23:57](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1437.76) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Say that again?

What are the top three specific changes needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced at GlueIQ?

[@24:10](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1450.98) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I don't think it would feel forced at all. I think whatever we put out there, I think it needs to be in context of work.

Agency in general, curiosity and ability to do more and produce more, I think adoption is easy. Okay.

[@24:44](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1484.06) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

So you don't feel any cultural resistance to adopt and use the tools?

[@24:49](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1489.26) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I'll be very surprised if you're giving them the right tool for them not to use it. Yeah.

[@24:56](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1496.34) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

What happens when an employee wants to use client data as an AI? Tool, is there an approval process? No.

Okay.

[@25:04](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1504.58) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

It should be, but I don't think it is.

Can you name your three most AI advanced competitors?

[@25:16](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1516.7) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

No. Okay. I mean, we are not an AI shop, so I don't know who would I name.

[@25:28](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1528.46) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

How about this? Can you name three consultancies that are using AI in a way that you admire?

[@25:36](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1536.94) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I mean, it's just starting. There are some consultancies that are starting to really focus on it. Mm-hmm. But names, names, names.

Robots and pencils. Robots and Robots pencils.

[@25:59](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1559.8) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Robots Robots

[@26:04](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1564.72) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

There are a few, I don't know, on top of my head, but there are a few that I just kind of, like our competitors, right?

Yeah. There is one that we work with very big things, but they're doing it completely different, actually very complementary to what we Those are the ones, because if you start, like, really looking at things that they do, it's very impressive.

[@26:41](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1601.44) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

If we surveyed your clients about whether you're an AI leader or laggard compared to other agencies, what would your clients honestly say?

Laggard. And what evidence shapes that view? Lag yekud.

[@26:57](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1617.24) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

For different clients, different things. Thank But I would say that the output and ability to move quicker and use it for insights, dashboards, and things like that, we are not on that level.

I think our best-selling product right now, which is dashboards, don't use any AI insights or anything that makes that super special.

What AI development in the next 18 months could fundamentally disrupt your business model?

[@27:40](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1660.26) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Like, if we do it or if other people do it?

[@27:46](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1666.68) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

A development that you could see happening in the field of AI, something that's new and next. This is really about when you think about what's happening in this space and you think about AI disruption, there's more information.

Thank What concerns you over the next 18 months?

[@28:04](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1684.92) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Ability to create agentic workflows that are easier to implement within the organization, which today don't exist. It's my personal opinion.

I think lots of people talk about it, but I don't think they exist. And I don't think, at least from where I'm sitting, I don't think people understand what you need to get ready for that to take full effect.

They think agentic, you just build it, and then everything is there. Not really. Meaning building it in vacuum, and then people start using it without really connecting it.

Thank Look Thank to everything that the company does. And I'm talking about marketing. If you expand that lens, it's times 100.

Yeah.

[@29:13](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1753.36) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Yep. If a competitor launched an AI service tomorrow that delivered GlueIQ's core offering 50% faster and 30% cheaper, how quickly could you respond?

Right now, we can't.

[@29:35](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1775.34) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

What would block you? AI developers. Ability to respond to that. No.

[@29:48](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1788.54) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

We don't have anybody building it.

[@29:52](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1792.48) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

Yeah. Anyone dedicated who's focused. used to put on Studio. you next time. Part of, at Sapien, part of my doings was building that nobody else can build, and testing, and constantly trying to stay on top of things, and having ability to build something.

Right now, we don't have that. Different people are playing with different things, like I am, but it's not a dedicated team that does things, that you can take and show to a client, and the client will go like, Jesus Christ, that's awesome.

On the product side, I'm not talking about, even on the creative, we are not pushing our people to create things just on their own.

[@30:55](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1855.94) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

That's really insightful. I appreciate that. That's great. As AI handles more analytical and routine work, what uniquely human value does GlueIQ bring that becomes more important?

Experience.

[@31:12](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1872.94) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

And how are you doubling down on that?

[@31:15](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1875.72) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

We're not.

[@31:16](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1876.94) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I mean, we're using that to sell business, but we are not doubling down on it. I think the experience and seeing it before, it goes a long way, just because clients still need that reinsurance that this change will benefit them.

Yeah. Because it's threatening right now. Yeah.

[@31:42](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1902.2) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

Can you name one specific AI capability or use case where GlueIQ is genuinely ahead of the market?

[@31:54](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1914.86) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

No. Okay.

[@31:58](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1918.12) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

All right, Boris. Three final questions. Questions to wrap up. First, what is the uncomfortable truth about GlueIQ's AI transformation that everyone knows, but no one says out loud?

That we are not doing it. Second, what's the one thing that if GlueIQ doesn't address in the next 90 days could derail your AI transformation?

[@32:24](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1944.7) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

There is no transformation. It's non-existent.

[@32:30](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1950.42) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)

And last but not least, what surprised you most about our conversation today? Nothing. All right. Thank you. This was great.

You're really candid. You had sharp answers for all of the things. It's, you know, you're the last interview, as I mentioned, across the LT, so you're the eighth person that I've spent some time with.

And you validated a lot of the things that I've already come to know, and you also added some new insight and truth that I think is really valuable.

So I really appreciate it.

[@33:12](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=1992.72) - Boris Stojanovic (GlueIQ)

I think, and I don't know what Gaston's plan with you guys, but we haven't even scratched the surface, and we talk about it, we sell it, but we don't do it.

So there is a big, big difference, and that's what keeps me up at night, because it's not, you have to do things to stay relevant and to, and we are not doing it.

[@33:49](https://fathom.video/share/XstLG-zH4H89KsAi7yxmiQHNzyiViXrX?timestamp=2029.7) - Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)
