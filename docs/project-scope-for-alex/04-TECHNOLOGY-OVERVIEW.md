## Monthly Infrastructure Costs

| Service | Estimated Cost |
|---------|----------------|
| Supabase (Database) | $25-100 |
| Netlify (Hosting) | $19-99 |
| Resend (Email) | $20-50 |
| Twilio (SMS) | $20-50 |
| AI Services (combined) | $100-300 |
| Domain/DNS | $20 |
| Neo4j | $0-100 |
| Sentry | $0-26 |
| **Total** | **~$200-750/month** |

*Costs scale with usage - higher when you have more users.*

---

## Why This Stack Matters

### 1. Scalability
This infrastructure can handle:
- 10 users or 100,000 users
- Without major changes
- Costs scale linearly with usage

### 2. Reliability
- All services have 99.9%+ uptime
- Redundancy built in
- Automatic backups

### 3. Security
- Bank-level encryption
- Compliance-ready (SOC2, GDPR)
- Regular security updates

### 4. Maintainability
- Modern, well-documented technologies
- Large developer community
- Easy to find help/contractors if needed

### 5. Future-Proof
- All technologies are actively developed
- Not locked into any one vendor
- Can evolve as needs change

---

## The Bottom Line

This is **enterprise-grade infrastructure** that:
- Fortune 500 companies use similar stacks
- Can scale to millions of users
- Is secure and reliable
- Costs a fraction of building in-house infrastructure

You're not paying for servers, IT staff, or security teams - that's all handled by these services.

**Total monthly infrastructure: ~$500-1,000** (scales with usage)

Compare that to:
- In-house IT infrastructure: $10,000-50,000/month
- IT staff to manage it: $15,000-30,000/month
- Security compliance: $5,000-10,000/month

**Savings: 90%+ vs. traditional infrastructure**
