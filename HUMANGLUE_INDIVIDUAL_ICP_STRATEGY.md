- Nurture successful graduates toward org-level purchase
- Offer "Manager's Pass" allowing team enrollment at individual tier
- Provide organizational introduction meeting for interested graduates

**Example:**
*Sarah completes Leadership Transformation Program → Sees value → Brings HumanGlue to her company as official L&D partner*

---

#### 2. Organizational → Individual Expansion
**Flow:** Organization purchases assessment, employees want personal development

**Strategy:**
- Offer employee discount for organizational clients (50% off individual programs)
- Position as "career insurance" for employees at transforming companies
- Create co-branded programs for client companies
- Alumni status for employees of client organizations

**Example:**
*Acme Corp purchases organizational assessment → 200 employees assessed → 30 employees enroll in personal programs at discount*

---

**For:** Small teams, departments, or entrepreneurial groups

**Structure:**
- Minimum 5 people, maximum 15

---

## MESSAGING BRIDGES BETWEEN B2C & B2B

### Organizational Messaging That Speaks to Individuals
When marketing to organizations, acknowledge individual concerns:

*"Your employees are already worrying about AI. Help them become AI-confident, not AI-anxious."*

*"Organizational transformation only works when individual employees feel empowered to transform."*

*"Invest in your people's AI readiness, and they'll drive your organization's AI success."*

---

### Individual Messaging That Acknowledges Organizations
When marketing to individuals, validate organizational context:

*"Don't wait for your company to invest in your AI education. The best time to upskill is before your organization demands it."*

*"When your organization starts its AI transformation, you'll be ready to lead—not follow."*

*"Position yourself as the AI expert your team needs—whether your company invests in training or not."*

---
