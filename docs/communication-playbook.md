## 💬 **SALES CALL SCRIPTS**

### **Discovery Call Script (15 minutes)**

**Minute 0-2: Rapport**
```
"Hey [Name]! Thanks for taking the time. I saw you [specific observation about their work/company].

Before we dive in - I want to make sure this is valuable for you. I'm not here to pitch anything today. My goal is to understand where you're at with AI and share what I'm seeing work for companies at your stage. Sound good?"
```

**Minute 2-5: Current State Questions**
```
"Let me ask you a few quick questions to understand your situation:

1. On a scale of 0-10, how would you rate your organization's AI maturity today?
   - 0 = "We haven't touched AI"
   - 10 = "AI is core to everything we do"

2. What prompted you to look into this now? What's the trigger?

3. What's your biggest frustration with AI right now?
   [Listen for: confusion, lack of ROI, can't scale, team resistance]

4. If you could wave a magic wand, what would AI help you accomplish in the next 90 days?

5. What have you tried so far? What worked? What didn't?
```

**Minute 5-10: Diagnosis & Insight**
```
"Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like you're at a [X] level on our maturity scale.

Here's what I'm hearing:
- [Restate their challenge]
- [Restate their desired outcome]
- [Restate what they've tried]

The good news: [Specific strength]
The gap: [Specific challenge]

Companies at your level typically struggle with [common pattern]. Does that resonate?

The path from [X] to [X+2] usually involves:
1. [Specific step 1]
2. [Specific step 2]
3. [Specific step 3]

Does that align with what you were thinking?"
```

**Minute 10-13: Soft Pitch (if they're interested)**
```
"So here's how we typically help companies at your stage:

[If low maturity 0-4:]
'We run a Strategy Workshop where we assess your current state, identify quick wins, and create a 90-day roadmap. Most companies find 3-5 opportunities they can implement immediately. Investment is $5K.'

[If mid maturity 5-6:]
'We have an Implementation Program - it's our workshop plus hands-on support for 90 days. You get templates, weekly check-ins, and access to our expert network. Investment is $10K.'

[If high maturity 7-10:]
'We typically work with companies at your level on retainer - ongoing optimization, team training, and keeping you ahead of the curve. Starts at $5K/month.'

Does that sound like it could help with [their stated goal]?"
```

**Minute 13-15: Next Steps**
```
"Great! Here's what I recommend:

[If they're ready:]
'I'll send over a proposal today with exact deliverables and timeline. You can review and let me know if you want to move forward. Fair?'

[If they need to think:]
'Totally get it. Let me send you [case study/more info]. When should I follow up?'

[If they're not ready:]
'No problem at all. Would it be helpful if I sent you [free resource]? And feel free to reach out when the timing is better.'

Thanks for your time, [Name]! Any other questions?"
```

## 🎤 **LINKEDIN POST TEMPLATES**

### **Post 1: Thought Leadership**
```
The 5 Stages of AI Maturity (and why most companies are stuck at Stage 3)

After assessing 50+ companies, here's what I've learned:

🔴 Stage 0-2: ANALOG
→ "We know AI exists but don't know where to start"
→ Overwhelmed by options, afraid of making wrong choice

🟡 Stage 3-4: EXPLORING
→ "We're experimenting with ChatGPT and a few tools"
→ No clear ROI, each team doing their own thing
→ THIS IS WHERE 60% OF COMPANIES ARE STUCK

🟠 Stage 5-6: IMPLEMENTING
→ "We have an AI strategy and we're rolling it out"
→ Starting to see results but struggling to scale

🟢 Stage 7-8: SCALING
→ "AI is embedded in our workflows"
→ Clear ROI, company-wide adoption

🔵 Stage 9-10: AUTOMATED
→ "AI is core to everything we do"
→ Competitive advantage, continuous innovation

The gap from 3 to 5 is the hardest jump.

Companies that make it:
✅ Get executive buy-in (not just bottom-up)
✅ Focus on 3 use cases max (not 20)
✅ Measure ROI from day 1

Where is your company on this scale?

#AIStrategy #DigitalTransformation #Leadership
```

**Why this works:**
- Education (teaches a framework)
- Diagnostic (people self-identify)
- Actionable (gives specific advice)
- Engagement bait (asks a question at the end)

---

### **Post 2: Case Study**
```
How [Company] went from AI chaos to clarity in 30 days:

The Problem:
→ 15 employees using 8 different AI tools
→ $3K/month in subscriptions, little to show for it
→ No governance, no standards, total confusion

What We Did:
1️⃣ Assessed current state (AI maturity: 3/10)
2️⃣ Consolidated tools (8 → 3)
3️⃣ Created use case playbooks
4️⃣ Trained teams on best practices

The Results (30 days):
✅ $1,800/month saved on redundant tools
✅ 10 hours/week saved per employee
✅ Clear ROI metrics established
✅ AI maturity increased to 6/10

The key insight?

Most companies don't have an AI problem.
They have a STRATEGY problem.

AI tools are everywhere. But without:
→ Clear use cases
→ Governance framework
→ Team alignment
→ ROI measurement

You're just burning money.

```

**Why this works:**
- Specific numbers (credible)
- Before/after (shows transformation)
- Clear process (repeatable)
- Call to action (generates leads)

---

### **Post 3: Controversial Take**
```
Unpopular opinion:

Most companies shouldn't invest in AI right now.

Here's why:

If you're at maturity level 0-2, you probably:
❌ Don't have clean data
❌ Don't have clear processes
❌ Don't have team buy-in
❌ Don't have measurement systems

Adding AI to broken processes just makes them break faster.

I've seen companies waste $50K+ on AI tools that sit unused because:
→ No one knows how to use them
→ The data isn't ready
→ The team is resistant
→ There's no clear ROI

My advice?

BEFORE investing in AI:
1️⃣ Document your current processes
2️⃣ Clean up your data
3️⃣ Define what success looks like
4️⃣ Get team buy-in

THEN implement AI.

The companies winning with AI didn't start with AI.

They started with:
→ Clear business problems
→ Strong fundamentals
→ A culture of experimentation

AI is the accelerator, not the foundation.

Agree or disagree?

**Why this works:**
- Contrarian (stops the scroll)
- Educational (teaches a principle)
- Builds authority (shows expertise)
- Starts conversation (divisive = engagement)

## 📞 **OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **Objection 1: "We're already using ChatGPT"**

**Response:**
"That's great! ChatGPT is an amazing tool. Quick question - are you tracking ROI on how your team is using it?

Most companies I talk to have teams using ChatGPT, but:
- No consistency in how they use it
- No way to measure value
- No governance around what data they're sharing
- Missing 80% of potential use cases

What we help with is taking that experiment and turning it into a strategy. We help you:
1. Identify your top 10 use cases (beyond just writing emails)
2. Create standard operating procedures
3. Train teams on advanced techniques
4. Measure actual ROI

Would it be useful to see what other companies at your level are doing with ChatGPT beyond the basics?"

---

### **Objection 2: "We don't have budget right now"**

**Response:**
"Totally understand. Let me ask - are you currently paying for any AI tools? ChatGPT Plus, Jasper, Copy.ai, anything like that?"

[If yes:]
"Interesting. So the average company we work with is spending $2-3K/month on AI tools but getting maybe 20% of the value. Our workshop typically identifies $1-2K/month in savings just from consolidating tools.

So the $5K investment often pays for itself in 3 months through reduced spending. Does that change the equation?"

[If no:]
"Fair enough. The free assessment is still valuable - it'll give you a roadmap for when budget does open up. And I can share some quick wins you can implement for free. Sound good?"

---

### **Objection 3: "We need to talk to our team first"**

**Response:**
"Absolutely - this should be a team decision.

Here's what I recommend: Let me send you a one-pager you can share with your team that outlines:
- What we'd cover
- Time commitment required
- Expected outcomes
- ROI analysis

Then we can do a 15-minute group call to answer any questions they have. Fair?

Also - do you want to take the free assessment first so you have specific data to share with them? That way the conversation is about 'here's where we are, here's the gap' rather than abstract AI strategy."

---

### **Objection 4: "We tried AI training before and it didn't work"**

**Response:**
"I hear that a lot. Can I ask - what didn't work about it specifically?"

[Listen for: too generic, not applicable, no follow-through, etc.]

"Yeah, most AI training fails because it's either:
1. Too generic (here's what ChatGPT can do!)
2. No implementation support (good luck!)
3. One-size-fits-all (works for marketing, not your industry)

What we do differently:
- Start with YOUR specific use cases (not generic examples)
- Industry-specific (what's working in [their industry])
- Implementation roadmap (not just inspiration)
- 30 days of support (so you don't get stuck)

Would it be helpful to see a sample roadmap from a company in [their industry]?"

---

### **Objection 5: "Can you just send me a proposal?"**

**Response:**
"Absolutely! I want to make sure the proposal is actually relevant to you.

Can I ask 3 quick questions so I can tailor it? (2 minutes)

1. What's your #1 goal with AI in the next 90 days?
2. What's your biggest concern or blocker?
3. What would make this a no-brainer investment?

[Get answers]

Perfect. I'll customize the proposal based on those and send it over by end of day. Fair?"

**Why this works:**
- Still sends proposal (doesn't lose deal)
- Gets critical info (to customize pitch)
- Shows you're not spray-and-pray
- 2 minutes is easy commitment
