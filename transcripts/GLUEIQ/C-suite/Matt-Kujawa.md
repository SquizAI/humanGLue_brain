[@0:00](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=0.0) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Legend, how are you? I'm good, man.

[@0:03](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3.28) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's good to see you, too, man.

[@0:05](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=5.04) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Let me turn off this blur thing. I hate this . Okay, there we go. What's good, brother?

[@0:10](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=10.52) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm coming to you live from my ancestral home, where I grew up.

[@0:16](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=16.98) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Ancestral? Whereabouts? I'm in Watertown.

[@0:21](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=21.32) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm visiting my mom for her birthday. Her birthday is tomorrow, came up yesterday, heading back Wednesday morning. So, yeah.

Yeah. Nice time of year, huh, up there? What's that? It's nice time of year up there. Oh, dude, it's beautiful.

All the trees are changing, the foliage looks fantastic. Looks great. Yeah.

[@0:44](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=44.52) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

My daughter's in Ithaca, Cornell, and she's like taking in the last bits of goodness before the long, dark winter.

What year is she there?

[@1:00](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=60.56) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

She's a junior? It's crazy to me that you have a kid that's a junior in college. It doesn't seem possible.

[@1:08](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=68.42) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Well, she's my second. I have a kid who's 23, working his first agency job in L.A.

[@1:15](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=75.7) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Wow. He was at Glue for two years.

[@1:23](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=83.14) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Really did well there. I remember that you have more kids than the Von Trapp family. They were that old.

[@1:34](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=94.12) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Well, and then every time I came to college, my wife gets another dog.

[@1:37](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=97.64) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

So we just got another puppy. So I've got four kids and four dogs. Because my third just started at UF.

And then I've got one little guy. Well, size-wise, he's not so little, but he's an eighth grader.

[@1:52](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=112.4) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I just got one and two dogs. Jagger is now 10. And we've got two dogs. And speaking of dogs,

My wife is launching a longevity product for dogs today, which is kind of cool. Oh, cool.

[@2:07](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=127.78) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. What kind of dogs do you have? So the first two are siblings, like three years apart. They're King Charo Cavaliers, ruby-colored.

And then the second two are Havapus, which is like half Havanese, which is a Cuban breed, kind of looks like a Shih Tzu, and Toy Poodle.

So they're little playful furry things. But they're all, you know, on the small side. So it's not like I'm walking around with like, you know, four labs or something like that.

They're pretty easy to manage. You know, outside of the  accidents in the house and stuff like that, which drive me crazy.

But, you know, puppy time. It's like, all right. Hey, get ready to replace the throw rugs in six months.

[@3:06](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=186.54) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@3:08](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=188.7) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Anyways.

**ACTION ITEM: Schedule Fri lunch w/ Matt after return - [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=194.9999)**

[@3:11](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=191.74) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Do you want to, I want to catch up with you a lot more. Do you want to jump into the assessment and then we can, if you have some time after, we can spend some more time just chatting?

[@3:23](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=203.08) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, let's get through what we need to and we can catch up a bit. And then, you know, when you're back, let's pick a Friday or something and grab some lunch.

[@3:30](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=210.48) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'd love that, man.

[@3:32](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=212.28) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

So do you know what this is?

[@3:34](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=214.84) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Sort of, kind of? Yeah.

[@3:37](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=217.42) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Gaston, I mean, super high level. So, you know, depth of explanation would be appreciated. But yeah, I know generally what, you know, what we're doing.

Cool.

[@3:50](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=230.72) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So, effectively, you know, AI is moving faster than, you know, speeding bullet as we all And the speed limit is humans.

And so looking at what I was doing in the disrupted workforce, which was all around thought leadership on how do we adapt and thrive through the future of work, the next iteration of that was, hey, rather than do thought leadership, why don't I actually create, you know, a company with a product that can help organizations kind of assess their transformation readiness.

Through people, process, and technology with a heavier lean on the people side. And really looking at, you know, what goes wrong in these transformations, trying to understand it and figure out how can you do something that is a win-win both for employees and for C-suite leaders.

Because when you go into most companies and you talk about employee transformation, they pitch you off to HR, they pitch you off to...

L&D teams, small budgets, low impact. And so this is the pilot project around what could be really valuable from assessing a group of C-suite leaders or an LT and then the employees underneath.

And so it uncovers kind of the gap in AI knowledge. It uncovers adaptability, tool use, shadow AI use, issues around governance, and also, I think, kind of the cultural piece, which is what is the company saying versus what are the employees saying and are they actually leaned in and bought in.

And so this is intended to be kind of a door opener project to run for companies that then you would build workshops and modules around.

And then I've got other products that I'm developing that come after this that are more around specifically kind of developing AI maturity.

models for individuals, for the organization, and then upscaling, you know, across roles and domains.

[@6:07](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=367.3) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, first of all, it's needed and super smart. I think for me, for me, AI is the current sort of content of the conversation.

And clearly, like, you know, I think so significant in a good way that like the barriers of change to sort of less significant transformations, like it's going to be a forcing mechanism.

But I would advocate that in all the transformation work that I've done, the people, process, tools, adoption, it's, you know, people and adoption that have been the biggest.

You know, gating, I don't want to say issue, but like, you know, gating factor to success, right? And like, especially with the MarTech stuff, we're on this 20 years of like, you know, the constant re-platforming, right?

Right. And usually when I go into an organization, their adoption and use of their current MarTech stack, it like barely scratches the surface, but it's so much easier to say, oh, it's, you know, we hate platform X, Y, or Z, or there's this new shiny object over here.

So let's go re-platform. And, you know, it's been this sort of cycle of sort of cycling technology, but the thing that's changed the least is how we organize, how we work together.

You know, to me, it's akin to like elementary school education, like the... The has  changed a hundred times over since that model began.

That model is the thing that's changed the least, right? So, I mean, to me, this is such a critical aspect of, you know, every organization's success.

People are messy and unpredictable and awesome and horrible and all those things at the same time. So it's a fascinating topic for me.

[@8:34](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=514.56) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Awesome, man. Well, I want to talk to you more about it. I want to get more thoughts. It's, you know, personal development work is my passion.

And, you know, when I left Sapien, it was, hey, the world's about to move a lot faster. AI is going to, I left in 2019, AI is going to go from behind the curtain to in our hands really soon.

I don't know what that's going to look like. Okay. I knew it was coming, and I knew that we wouldn't be ready.

And so how do you kind of reimagine at the enterprise level what does that new model of change actually look like?

I need to put my cell phone on silent for a second. Okay. So, yeah, I'm really passionate about this and trying to come up with something that's unique and compelling and different in the marketplace and then go sell it with you guys.

So, all right. For the purposes of the note taker, we are going to begin the interview now. So I'll see that in the transcript.

Okay, great. All right. right. Um... Okay. Matt Kujawa, great to see you. What we are doing, thank you for taking the time.

The conversation here is to help understand where GlueIQ is on the Glue transformation journey. That's the human Glue transformation journey from individual growth and leverage to organizational unity and strategic evolution.

I'm really interested in your candid perspective on what's working, what's not, and where you see the gaps. There are no wrong answers in the value from comparing leadership and employee perspectives to reveal opportunities.

That's where the value comes from. Everything we discuss is confidential and will be aggregated to create insights, not to evaluate individual folks.

So before we dive into AI specifically, can you tell me about a time when GlueIQ successfully rolled in?

[@11:22](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=682.741) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I mean, I'll be honest with you. I think it's been a while since we have rolled out something successfully.

I think, and there's all kinds of reasons for that, though I'm sure we're going to unpack, but I think early on in the sort of origin years, it was a blank slate, right?

And it was a much simpler context just in terms of the sort of number of people, right, like 20 and under.

And so some of the new stuff that we were putting in... ... ... ... ... You know, went well.

I think some of the reasons why, let me pick one. Like, you know, our first sort of agency operations platform, professional services management platform was called Mavenlink.

And I think that rollout went well for a number of reasons. First, I think there was alignment that it was the right choice.

So we took the time to look at options. I think there was enough sort of recent frustration and all the sort of bloated tools and process that we had all experienced.

We had, for the most part, experienced at the same place, right? So I think there was a common understanding of what we didn't want.

Um, I think it also, um, covered a lot, like it was a single platform that had sort of good coverage of like basic needs that we had, um, in one place, uh, which was also ultimately, was downfall.

It like, like fell short on a couple of things that as we grew became critically more important. Um, so it, you know, all those little things that can, um, sort of hinder people adopting something like I got to log into five places and I'm not sure which thing does what, and I do this over here, but what about this over here?

It simplified a lot of that sort of messiness, you know, in an environment where like, um, and this, I think this is a, an indicator across Glue in an, in an environment of high growth.

Um, it's hard to take the time. to make time, right, for your own processes and systems and adoption and alignment.

And so, again, I think it was just sort of like a petri dish of a lot of things that made that one successful.

You know, we're on our third iteration of similar platform. I think the one we picked in the middle, a lot of people felt like it was the wrong choice.

I feel like it could have worked. But in the end, like that one was not successful. Recently, like we put in productive and I would say that's a successful launch because for all the opposite reasons, don't like I think we got lucky with this one because it.

Thank Because it's a good fit. But that was like, you know, like even myself, for example, that was like, like heavily involved in the first two rollouts.

I was like on some partner meeting and someone's like, yeah, we're in the second phase of productive. I'm like, what the  is productive?

Like, like, I didn't even know we're making a change. So, you know, Gaston got me aligned quickly. And frankly, I was happy to not be involved in, in, in, in the rollout.

But I will say, like, that's still like a little bit of a, I don't know how that happens, right?

Like something that's so fundamental to a company that I am partial owner of, like, I don't know how that decision gets made without more transparency.

But it was like, a good choice. I'll put aside that sort of like, you know, frustration. And I think we did some of the right things in that rollout, which was, I think, you know, it matches our collective mental model, right, on how projects and finances work, makes easy, you know, a handful of things that have been, you know, complex for us in the past.

And I think we've been smarter about saying, like, look, these eight things you have to do in Productitive, these are non-negotiables.

These are some best practices for sort of the next wave of things and how it can be useful to you.

And the rest is sort of, like, use Productive, use some other tool, whatever, you know, whatever is better fitting the context of your situation, right?

Because in some of the other ones, it's like, it's our project management tool. It's we task people internally. Well, a customer-facing project plan that you're sharing on a portal is not the same.

You don't actually want your client to have complete transparency and all the tiny bits and pieces of how the work is truly getting done.

And so when you try to make one thing work for a bunch of different use cases, I think you're sort of setting yourself up for failure.

So last thing I'll say is there's a handful of people and, unfortunately, some partners, some other sort of critical leaders that say all the right things, oh, yeah, we're going to use it or whatever, and then they really have no intention of it and kind of just go back to whatever they were doing previously, right?

So that, I think, is... So, of all the challenges we face, to me, that is the biggest sort of, you know, weed with deep, deep roots that we need to pull out, which is partner alignment on a ton of this stuff.

[@18:18](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1098.78) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's really helpful. And I like kind of the context between, you know, the earlier project and the one that went more recently.

It's a good juxtaposition, so it's good. I'm going to dive into the AI stuff now. I should tell you, there's a bunch of questions.

There's quite a few, so I just want to let you know from a timing perspective. So starting with you personally, what AI tools did you use yesterday or this week in your actual work?

[@18:55](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1135.42) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

A bunch. A bunch. A bunch. bunch. A bunch. A I know there's a lot of questions up, and I'm going to be much faster, but just to set context, and it has a lot to do with my son, Caden, who's, you know, fresh out of college, very inquisitive, and it's like, I got re-intervigorated about two years just in conversations with him.

Um, I started, um, sort of binge-watching, you know, YouTube videos, like, you know, keynote addresses from conferences, everything about six months ago, and forcing myself to set aside four or five hours every week, even if it was at the cost of, like, sleep, to try new things, right?

Um, and so, um, I use a bunch in, in, sort of, for personal productivity. Uh, one is I use a little...

Bird, which is effectively just like a screen record, like you give it screen recording access, it watches you all day, and it helps someone like me, who's like a bit disorganized, ADD, you know.

Did you want to finish booking that flight? Put it on your to-do list tomorrow. Like, did you need help setting up, you know, you have three draft emails partially completed that you never sent.

Did you need to send those? So, like, it's kind of like just kind of helping stay on track. I use Google LM a lot for very specific context, although more recently, last week and this week, I've been, I've been using clawed projects and skills as a, as a bit more, um, yeah.

A bit more enterprise grade, right? Like, you know, I think Notebook Alima is great, has a broad set of use cases, has some fun outputs.

But like when I'm really thinking about producing artifacts that I used to do myself for client work, I've been playing with that.

I use Perplexity a lot, specifically Perplexity Labs or Deep Research. I don't use it much just for the normal like original use case.

And then an area where I've been really getting deep into tooling is in the design to dev to production workflow for websites and apps.

[@21:40](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1300.5) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Cool.

[@21:41](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1301.0) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

And, you know, I've had a personal, you know, because it's probably where I've done 70% of my work, the inefficiencies from taking something from a design to a live website or application.

But... is ridiculously flawed, and it always has been, and so that's an area of passion for me for decades, and so I'm testing a bunch of stuff there, but primarily using a product by Builder.io called Fusion.

The full workflow is Figma, a design system automation platform called Supernova, Fusion, which is where the heaviest AI is, and then VS Code, GitHub, and Vercel or Netlify, that whole tool suite is literally turning work that...

Could take... To me, it's one of the... Biggest sort of time and quality gains of anything that I've been dabbling with.

Kind of like it's a little mind-boggling. Game changer.

[@23:13](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1393.0) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@23:14](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1394.9) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

And what's really interesting to me is I think designers, especially like in the digital world where, you know, what they're envisioning requires a maker or developer or an engineer to see it through, have an unnatural break, right, in there.

It'd be like asking a sculptor to, you know, sketch something, have an idea, and like get it like roughly done as a sculpture, and then someone else has to come in and finish it.

And so I'm trying to find ways for designers to go deeper into what actually gets built. Not in some vibe code or prototype mentality, like while maintaining the path towards productionalization.

[@24:10](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1450.18) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Great answer. Building on that, if you could have an AI expert, quote unquote, because no one is an expert because it's moving so fast, sit with you for two hours and teach you one thing about AI, no one else is watching, what would you want to learn?

[@24:32](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1472.46) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I would want to learn, this is true, I think, from a personal role, like my personal job and what we do at Glue, but also work with enterprise clients is the...

The, you know, I see the way that I use AI and... did... Yeah. that's... and... I'm... I'm... And... You know, clients too, is these are like software applications, I'm missing the operating system.

And it doesn't have to be the same operating system, like there's going to be multiple offerings just like there is today.

But I think for an organization to, you know, scale AI, to, you know, adopt it meaningfully, to connect sort of one workflow or use case to another, you know, loosely these sort of agentic backphones.

But then like, you know, built in privacy and safety and lineage and, you know, collaboration and sharing, like the only way that I can get, and I'm starting to see some of that in Claude.

I was really trying to get like NAN to work for us for a while, but it really just the, like, what's the AI version?

Hey, all use Macs, and stop using Google Slides, everybody. We, unfortunately, are using beautiful AI now, but just some common tooling and some fundamentals, just like I was talking about Productive, where it's like, at the floor, what are those foundations?

Because I'm putting a lot of personal effort into how I and we and our company and my clients can use AI, and I don't want to continue to put all that effort in such a scattered way.

I want some focus and some fundamentals, and, you know, to me, again, like, yeah, I find some interesting things around cloud projects and skills that is different from ChatGBT's new projects and stuff, but at the end of the day, those are far...

Those differences are far less important than, like, scaled focus, even for just me as an individual in one place, and really thinking instead more about, like, the use cases, how is it changing, or how can it change, like, the work that I'm doing, then it would be like, oh, well, this one's slightly better than this at, you know, whatever.

So that would be, like, just put me on the right path so that this effort I'm working on will have more value in the long run.

And I've got that focus in that design-to-dev-to-production piece. I know what the right tooling is there because I spent the time to figure it out, or at least I know what a good set of tooling is, but that was, like, 18-month journey.

And so, yeah, that would be the most beneficial for me.

[@28:01](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1681.36) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Kind of make it easy from setting up the right frameworks and tools, make it more use case oriented than based on, you know, which LLM or which tool is on the margin better than the other to really kind of.

[@28:22](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1702.84) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, that and to know that like, hey, you know, I'll put this in the context of Glue now, right?

It's like, if I'm, if we've sort of figured out what our fundamental tooling is, again, for the majority of coverage, and I'm working on like, some piece of my workflow, and some other piece of my workflow, and I know Gaston is working on something and some like, eventually, that's going to be exponentially additive to something better.

[@28:56](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1736.94) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But if I'm chasing like, Claude and figuring out how to do this here.

[@29:00](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1740.0) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

and someone else is doing this here. It's diverging, not converging. When this one over here, this one over here, this one over here, there might be all very similar with, again, with just some specificity of like, well, this one's a little better here.

So getting our organization on a limited set of like platforms, right? And look, by the way, it doesn't mean eight months from now, you can take that collective set of accomplishments and replumb it somewhere else if there's a somewhere else that emerges better and faster.

But that's going to be a whole lot easier than 27 different things on 21 different platforms.

[@29:53](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1793.12) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, yeah. And that's also, I think, you know, just a way in. I think that's part. to this moment where we are in the AI wild, wild west, and you have 31 flavors of Baskin-Robbins, and it's like, can we just limit it to chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, please?

[@30:16](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1816.4) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Or when, like, you know, I'll just, like, if we decide, for example, like, hey, let's go primarily focus as a group on OpenAI and their platform and their API and their tooling.

And, you know, from a data perspective, whatever we decide to do there, right?

[@30:50](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1850.64) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Mm-hmm.

[@30:51](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1851.26) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

And everyone's trying to, you know, work in those same guardrails, unless someone goes like, Yeah, know we could probably do this here, but this other thing came along.

To me, deviation from standards is great. When you do it with discipline and intent for a reason, going back to the dev to design handoff thing, my biggest frustration is people deviate for a thousand reasons.

Very few of them are strategic or intentful. Right. So having that sort of core, hey, we're all marching in this direction, maybe a couple outliers of like, I'm going to go try this or pilot this, is just, and I don't know, like, you know, I don't know what that is, right?

Because that's where my skill gap comes in. And by the way, even when I know what it is, getting our crew to  stay, you know, stay on something is impossible.

And, and... And part of what I'm so bullish on that AI it's about is with the right guardrails and sets of instructions and context is actually doesn't deviate, right?

Or shouldn't. Yeah. And for me, if we can stop people from, you know, deviating for the reasons that don't matter on mid to low value tasks and exercises and have sort of conformity, then deviation becomes around critical thought, leadership, new ideas.

Not around like, oh, I just, I couldn't remember my password and I got this other thing or like, I never liked that tool anyways.

I'm just going to, whatever the thousand reasons are, right?

[@32:53](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1973.36) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. A hundred percent. I agree. Can you tell me about a time when AI revealed?

[@33:09](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=1989.28) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Tell me about a time when AI revealed something that completely surprised you or challenged your assumptions. I mean, daily?

Look, for me, the most, to me, and this is kind of a higher level thought, but, you know, we've been working with technically in our field, right, AI for decades, right?

Any kind of machine learning or automation is using some sense of machine intelligence, right? And so, you know, when I was working on Universal Orlando,

When we were building like some of the first big sort of LLMs into the app, the use case was to, you know, the parks are all about load balancing, right?

Like they don't want every one of the restaurant at the same time. They build those big, you know, lines inside of boxes so that when you're walking around the park, you don't realize there's actually, you know, 20 times more people than it feels like.

And so, you know, moving people around the park, there's actually a term for it. They call it body movement.

Intelligently, right, through prompts and exchange of value in the apps, like that's where I thought AI was going. Analytics use cases, research use cases, know, dealing with large, large volumes of information.

man. man. this I agree When, like, I never expected AI to come for the creative fields as quickly as it did at a level that just, you know, like, I always thought of it as more of like a scientific and engineering domain than a creative domain, right?

Right. So that, like, unhinged, like, that to me was like a, and it wasn't even like just chat GBT, like the, you know, when it first released and the, like, I was more blown away by like mid journeys and miscreation than I was by chat GBT.

Like, I'm like, okay, chat is like, okay, it's like, you know, it's a combination of the smartest model we've seen in an IO that like, you know, how long we've been talking about chat bots were actually horrible.

So I knew that was like going somewhere big. But, you know, like, the mid-journey stuff early on, was just like, this is insane.

And that didn't, I didn't expect that. I think the other thing that, less sort of fundamental or philosophical is just the, the ability.

You know, the ability to, like, truly collaborate, right, and evolve, like, evolve thinking, the back and forth, you know, one idea, have you thought about it?

But, like, that I've been kind of surprised, like, how sort of personally, you know, rewarding that is. To have that again, know, being out of there, like I'm a water cooler person, right?

Like I was dying in COVID when like I'm horrible at organization planning meetings and remembering to do things and I need to have a five minute conversation with someone and that's something I have to be like proactive about or remember to do it and book it instead of just like, oh, hey, I've been finding like similar high level like dialogue.

And intellectual, like exploring intellectual curiosity that I used to have with people. And that's also kind of an unexpected, the quality at which that is happening is kind of surprised me a lot.

[@37:48](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2268.48) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Compared to other executives, know, in similar roles, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency? Ahead, behind or on par?

[@38:05](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2285.26) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I mean, would say knowledge ahead, adoption and use on par, probably, or maybe slightly ahead. I haven't settled into, well, and it's hard to, right, because it's changing so fast, but I think, I don't know, maybe some people like at bigger organizations or something that have this support.

Like, I, it's funny, I have a meeting later with Gaston to talk about it, which is like, we don't actually have not a single true specialist in-house on the most important, you know, thing in the world right now.

And so what's happening is the people that are inquisitive, which is another challenge with our people, almost across the board to me, so people like Gaston, myself, are spending an enormous amount of time stumbling through some of the basics, setup, configuration, what tools should we use, do I need a local server for that?

Like, so I think that sort of would be far more, I think, ahead if I was at a bigger place and, like, there was some of that structure there, and then it was more about use cases, adoption, retooling, like, how you go about your day.

Like, a lot of those things I just want to be taught and told, and I'll use the hell out of them, right?

so.

[@40:00](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2400.7) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If you had to bet your job on one AI-driven innovation for the company, what would it be and why?

[@40:30](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2430.56) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I think it would be around the data strategy and analysis use cases. I think that our superpower is one thing, and for all the reasons why it's good, it's also the biggest challenge that we've had.

Scaling our business, which is, you know, a handful of the partners can go into any meeting on any topic with very little prep and hang in the conversation and actually, like, start to see, like, emerging, like, like, problem definition and emerging approaches, like, like, it's crazy, right?

Like, you know, get in the room with whether it's, like, Joey Gaston and me or me and Boris and, you know, like, again, depending on the flavor of topics, but because our, you know, we don't, like, say, hey, this is what the agency does.

I mean, we do within reason, like, but we don't have, like, structured offerings. We don't do outbound, right? We don't do growth around those things.

We get passed around to, like, former clients. And, you know, who are C-suite executives now, as they move around, they bring us into a new thing, or they hand us off to one of their friends or whatever.

And so, you know, it's all referral and relationship driven, which means your services are whatever problems those people are having.

[@42:16](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2536.36) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Right.

[@42:17](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2537.19) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Loosely in the domain of, like, marketing, advertising, brand, digital product, commerce, right? Like, and so we get, you know, most of that kind of work starts with audits and discovery.

And even if it's not consulting, right, even if it's just like, hey, I need to rebuild a brand or launch a new product, we start with that sort of, you know, highly analytical piece, which, again, the same people that can go in that room and have that conversation are the only people we have that can actually do that work.

At a meaningful level, right? Like, think once some things get established, but then, you know, again, this is where I have a...

The with just the general disposition of our people is even after you've done part A, which is the opportunity, hanging in that conversation, and you've established the things to set it on its path, our people are wired so differently that then it becomes a babysitting job.

And you turn away for a week because some new thing came up and you come back to a project and you're like, what happened?

And so obviously that model doesn't scale. Wow. And then I'm also just finding the depth and quality of when it has the right context in Canvas and the right series of prompting that's more based around inquisitive discovery versus just give me an answer.

That I think could be... That meaningful for us, and thinking differently about that whole piece is what's exciting.

[@44:09](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2649.49) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Let's talk a little bit more about your people. Who would you say are the top three AI-fluent people in the organization, not by title, but by actual capability?

[@44:26](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2666.37) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

You mean like you want people's names?

[@44:29](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2669.27) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, names, what makes them stand out?

[@44:43](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2683.59) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I mean, honestly, I think it's like me, Gaston, and I think there's... ... ... ... There's a young gal, name's Angie.

She was an intern, and we hired her. She's agency operations. I don't think she's bringing it into the construct of work yet, but we do these Glue Tuesday things where someone speaks on a topic, and then we do a three-minute, like, everything you didn't know about me, like, this is who Angie is, and, like, in, she's, you know, doing some, like, social good, and as it relates to AI, and, like, just the stuff that she's thinking about, like, AI, and just sort of, like, the world, and being, like, a good person and a good citizen.

I don't know, and, again, only followed up with her a few minutes on it, but, like, I just don't.

know anyone, likely has to do with age, right, of my peers that's, like, not thinking about AI as, like, a work tool or personal productivity.

Like, she's just thinking about it, like, at a, like, seeing it as a, I don't know, like, a much bigger thing.

I don't see a lot of, like, you know, it's the same, like, yeah, like, people are, you know, cheating on their job.

Like, chat GBT to make a few quick things faster, like, note-taking or whatever. But I don't know. Like, I try to do this AI first Fridays where, like, first Friday of the month, it was just, like, a Friday open forum.

Like, hey, how are people, like, what are they messing around with? Do you see promise? If so, like, who else wants to jump on that with you?

Like, who, and, you know, um. Like, none of the partners came, like, you know, a handful of people, and like, it was a good conversation.

There's another, I'll give you one more name, Casey Woods, I think is thinking about it a lot, and doing, you know, like sort of trying new things.

I don't think, though, he's the kind of person that, like, has the, it's not a, it's not a knock on him.

Like, you know, is he bringing, you know, he's a creative director, like, is he bringing his juniors along? Is he reimagining, like, what this could mean for Glue?

I think he could, if someone was like, you know, pulling that out of him, or if it was like an official assignment, right, which is like, all right, we know you've been, you know, thinking, doing, but yeah, I mean, it goes back to like, I just don't find our.

I think it's a combination of, like, a lot of busy people, right, like, especially on the aging side and creative, like, just turning the cycle, right, getting through the day.

I think we've got, you know, we have a habit of, like, hiring our friends and known entities. I think there's some level of, like, comfort, laziness, comfort, laziness kind of a thing.

[@48:33](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2913.33) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@48:33](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2913.91) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

And then I just think, like, there's, like, we're, you know, for all the reasons that I told you, right, like, leadership is busy, right, and below us is, like, not the typical next, like, there's just not enough inquisitive people.

[@48:54](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2934.29) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@48:55](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2935.31) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Wait, they're waiting to be told what, what I do, I do it this way today. You tell me when I do it the AI way.

[@49:03](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2943.53) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yep, yep. So the next question I would ask you would be, what percentage of your people would you say are genuinely AI capable today?

And I'm guessing that's a low percentage, but I'm going to ask you a follow-up. I'll give you a sec, just a number.

[@49:25](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2965.63) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Like AI, using it to some material value, personally, or 20%? Okay.

[@49:36](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=2976.33) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The next question I know the answer to, I'm going to ask it for note-taking purposes, and then I'm going to ask it a different way.

So the question is, do you have an AI upskilling budget program and participation? How many people, what investment, and what outcome are you measuring?

And the question that I'm going to ask instead is, what have been the conversations around creating an AI upskilling?

[@50:03](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3003.83) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Sure. I want to go back one more question to answer it differently. I think that with the right investments and approach, for all the reasons why that group frustrates me, like when you point them in a direction and say, go break down those 10 walls in front of you, they do it, and they do it really well.

And so I think we could be at 80% or 90%. And that's a leadership failure. And so no, we have no AI plan, no investment from a structured standpoint.

I think we've obviously bought a couple of tools or whatever. Or, you know, for me, say the third one again.

How do you want me to answer it? What should it

[@51:00](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3060.01) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Um, what have been the conversations around creating an AI upskilling program for the organization?

[@51:11](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3071.61) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I mean, we, we, um, we, we, we, we've talked about it for a while. I don't know that, um, look, I would say that like in the last four weeks, um, at least from my perspective, like it's, it's the, the, the need to make investments and to sort of stop being the, you know, shoemakers kids, which we, um, always are is like, we all know that we have to, we, we have to do something formal, right.

Um, and I think, you know, um. And I think there's a realization that we need some help, right, which to me, like when Gaston was like, we're doing this and you're going to have the interview, I'm like, thank God.

Like, thank God we're doing something formal because we've said things like, you know, I don't know, like I had dinner with Gaston three months ago and I'm like, I'm leaving Glue.

You need to tell me like when and how that's supposed to work because I just can't do it anymore in such a sort of like non-deliberate way that we're doing things, AI being a part of that, but just in general.

So, um, and, uh, part of that conversation and I believe like with all the, all the best intentions on his part in mind was, okay, like, don't take any more, you know, see these three.

See these few things through, you know, this one client, like, you need to stay on that, because it's our biggest opportunity, and I have the most context.

But we won't do anything new, and then, like, know, 60% of your time, and, like, make a plan, and set a budget.

And it's like, you know, two weeks, like, what's the saying? Like, no battle, even the best battle plans don't survive first contact.

It's like two weeks later, new thing came in, which, by the way, like, I was excited about, so getting me out of my slump.

Another thing grows, and it's like, we've to be honest with ourselves, that, like, even in the areas where we could help ourselves, we're not making the time, or able to make the time, right?

No finger point, it just... Like to, to make some meaningful change. And then I also feel like, you know, go back to something I said earlier is like, look, there's a handful of partners that this is, this is not AI, this, this, to me even comes down to just like operations, which is like, doesn't matter that you're a partner, this is not optional.

[@54:22](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3262.85) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Like it's not optional to the, to the future of this business.

[@54:27](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3267.33) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Right. And I think AI is one of the most critical pieces of that. So having someone from the outside can't come in so that it's not this like, kind of like, oh, we have two partners that have dissenting opinions on how we should do X or what we should do about Y.

[@54:44](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3284.55) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Mm hmm. Who's negotiating that?

[@54:47](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3287.59) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Well, usually it's Gaston. And, you know, I'm probably like the worst at manipulating him. There's others that are far better.

[@54:57](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3297.95) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Um, so.

[@55:00](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3300.01) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

And, you know, I think that objective, like, and then we're short on the subject matter expertise, right? Like, for the first time in a long time, there's something that, like, a couple of us, me, Gaston, Boris primarily, are trying to get as smart as we can.

But 50% of the time we're spending is probably pointed against something that is solved already by someone with expertise or, you know, just pointed in the wrong direction, right?

So I think it's critical. I would even say, like, you know, take a page out of, like, some of the executives' books that we know.

no more new hires for six months. And those investments are going into, you know, this initiative and solving our inefficiencies.

And now, does it really mean you won't hire anybody in six months? I'm not sure there could come an edge case.

It's like, what do you do when you have to cut costs at a huge company?

[@56:08](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3368.77) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No one can travel.

[@56:10](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3370.29) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Well, the only way you can get people to stop traveling is to say no one can travel. Of course, people put in pretty pleas and get approvals, but I feel like we have to draw some line in the sand as a forcing mechanism for some change.

[@56:29](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3389.51) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. I should tell you, we have a lot left to go through. So what I love about the way that you're answering these is you're giving me a lot of context that I think will actually contribute to some of the other questions.

All right, I can rip through them.

[@56:48](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3408.93) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Go, let's go.

[@56:51](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3411.57) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Looking 18 months out, what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today? What would Sam Altman or...

What tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit the gap?

[@57:10](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3430.71) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I think much like I'm thinking about the design to dev to production, that's great, except it's something we do ad hoc.

It's not like our core offering. We need to completely retool our agency workflow for marketing services from planning through delivery and optimization.

The tooling, training the team, completely rethink it.

[@57:51](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3471.83) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We're going to move into the leverage section. How are you measuring ROI and AI investments?

[@57:59](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3479.27) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Do you have any... Do metrics you can share? No, we haven't made any AI investments, so the ROI is out.

Do I think as part of taking this on more deliberately, we have to think and do like we tell our clients to do, and we have to understand investment and return and track to those, and so I think it will be very important.

Yeah.

[@58:33](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3513.17) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Who's ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use in the organization, and how does that work day to day?

Okay. What's prevented you from establishing that?

[@58:49](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3529.51) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Um, you know, time, lack of a structured program, where that would be one part of a structure. Maybe, you know, lack of perceived importance in terms of a few other things ahead of that, and maybe not really truly understanding the  shitstorm that you can step in.

We just haven't, like, conceptualized that for what we do. I think we're starting to see it a little bit.

And then just in general, like, we're risk takers and startup.

[@59:37](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3577.73) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

This is a question about tool abandonment. What AI tool or initiative did you invest in but ultimately abandon, and what happened and what did you learn?

[@59:56](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3596.31) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I think we made, like, we made it an investment. In time, or at least I think personally, a couple of us did.

I think I tried to make one inside the company. might have been like the, and even though it wasn't great, so I'm not like, but it's the one example where our head of technology was not real AI wired, but he had a lot of the skills that fundamentally need.

We got NNN set up and on-prem, not SaaS. We got some environments going. It was the summer, so we had some interns, and I met with a couple of different groups, and I was just trying to get people.

Like, to me, I felt like it was the workflow tool that was, you know, kind of came out of nowhere, and then it couldn't look anywhere without seeing it.

Um, and then, um, uh, why did we abandon it? Well... Three reasons. One is, you know, we parted ways with the technologists, so, you know, the environments and then, you know, tooling connections.

This was just the beginning of, like, MCP, so, like, some of the tooling was, you know, not working anymore.

The interns left. So I feel like it was, like, sort of plagued a bit because it didn't have formality.

We were just trying to make some sort of orchestrated effort. then ultimately it came to, I stopped pushing it because I'm like, is that even the right thing anymore?

And that goes back to the beginning of our conversation, right? So those are the three reasons, right?

[@1:01:52](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3712.83) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

This question, I think, is less relevant. But if you think there's an answer, you can say skip or if you want to give an answer.

If your board investors or partners challenge your AI investment tomorrow saying, prove this is worth it, what evidence would you show them, and what questions would you hope they don't ask?

[@1:02:17](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3737.41) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Instead of skip, I would say if we were trying to defend the need for an investment, I would bring forth areas of promise where a few of us are really kind of seeing, wow, this is very relevant to us.

What I would probably hide is sort of how poor we're doing today.

[@1:02:47](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3767.75) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Speed to market, can you give me an example where AI dramatically changed your delivery timeline in terms of what was possible that wasn't before?

[@1:02:58](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3778.13) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Sure. I mean, I would say... In advisory artifacts, analysis, organization, partially complete deliverables, I'm getting those things done 70% faster with higher quality and depth, and a few people working on that kind of work are doing the same.

Yeah.

[@1:03:25](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3805.15) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What's one thing your competitors deliver with AI that you can't match yet, and how long until you close the gap?

[@1:03:43](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3823.09) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I would actually say we have like boutique advisory competitors that, you know, we can... So we can have the conversation around how transformational AI is going to be, where they should make in their investments, the right way to go about it, how you have a PMO and disciplined approach.

Um, we can't get into actual recommendations on the right set of initiatives, the right sort of tooling selection process, again, outside some very specific use cases, non-technical platforms, maybe, um, where there's already a UI.

So I think our competitors are, um, and I don't mean to say that we're, you know, fake it till you make it.

Cause I do believe the few people that are playing in that space don't speak out of turn when it gets into like actual hands-on approach.

We're helping them much like this conversation is around, you know, a structured approach. It's all, it's not all that different to any transformation.

Again, just. It's going to happen much faster. So our competitors that have real domain knowledge, we don't have that.

[@1:05:07](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3907.83) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Last question of this section. What customer problem could we solve with AI that we always assumed was unsolvable?

[@1:05:33](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3933.09) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

So data consolidation, and I don't mean all in one place in the enterprise, like the ability to have a consolidated view of the right data to act upon.

Obviously, the acting upon it is going to be kind of different, but this whole idea of like, you know, we're a data-driven, you know, insights, marketing, like...

Very few people have actually pulled that off. So I think the, you know, and that's just even small groups.

I think the enterprise complexity of systems and information, you know, when we start seeing, like, that, I'll just answer the question.

That's the answer. I think there's a philosophical topic that I am dying to know if I'm right on, but, yeah.

[@1:06:34](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=3994.95) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So we got two more sections. If we go quick, we can probably land the plane at three. Do you have a hard stop at three?

[@1:06:43](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4003.17) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

No. Okay.

[@1:06:44](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4004.87) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So the Unite Stage assessment, this is around social learning and organizational change. Shadow AI awareness. What AI tools do you suspect your employees are using that aren't officially approved, and how do you know?

[@1:07:03](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4023.73) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

A bunch, and I hope they are. We only have, like, a handful. My guess would be, you know, predominantly is, like, chat and, like, MidJourney or, like, some of the other, like, image gen stuff, like Adobe.

So, you know, it's all kind of shadow AI just because we don't have, you know, an official tooling.

[@1:07:28](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4048.95) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So, yeah. Data democracy. Who in your organization has access to AI-powered insights? What's the real picture of who can see what?

[@1:07:46](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4066.11) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Well, look, for our own data and our own operations, like, I mean, we're not, I don't know that our employees are that inquisitive around.

I mean, all the data has always been there for, I mean. Outside of exact to the person's salaries, if you're smart enough, cost rates are exposed, people could do the math and understand basically what someone generally makes, and all of our time tracking data, people have access to all of that.

I would say that not enough people have access to the data that they need to really do an exemplary job for their clients.

That's a client issue that needs to be solved. So, I don't know, 20%, 25% have, and likely those 20%, 25%, it's either their job, right, to break down those barriers and bring consolidated data together, or they're just wired that way, right?

Like, they have to have the information at some depth to... Go to the next step. They can't skip that step.

So maybe 25%, 30%, something like that.

[@1:09:07](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4147.13) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What happens when an employee wants to use client data with an AI tool? Is there an approval process for that?

[@1:09:15](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4155.99) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

No. No. And my guess is like, I think there's a sensitive, like people are sensitive to client data. For the most part, right?

I don't know that there's a real understanding of, like if someone's like, oh, I'm using, you know, we rolled out, like we, I don't have to use my personal one anymore.

Now we have ChatGPT. I think there's a perception that that's a safe environment for client, like just the same as you uploaded to the GlueIQ Google Drive.

I don't think there's a true understanding of what like leakage looks like in, in the context. We'll at The of LLMs and AI.

Frankly, I don't understand the true depth of it either.

[@1:10:07](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4207.13) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's, yeah.

[@1:10:08](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4208.17) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

We know that we're doing a bunch of  we shouldn't be doing.

[@1:10:12](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4212.83) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Last one of this section, and I think this is an important one. Name the top three specific changes for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced at GlueIQ.

[@1:10:37](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4237.95) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Look, I think the first one is, like, is, you know, bringing it in to what people are doing today in a way that, like, feels valuable to them.

And I know there's tons of opportunity to do that. So this isn't like, you know, I think our people, like...

The thing that resonates with them, most of them do get this, is like, no one is running around in our office like, oh, my God, AI is going to take my job.

I think that idea of like the people who are coming for your job are the ones who wield AI to their benefit, right?

And so I think one is like, you know, like really helping people in sort of micro teams or individuals like, look, we have this thing.

This is how you use it. Let us get you working on this. I think that's one. And, you know, the other is like, just, you know, how do we find the just lowest level mundane, like stuff that people that hate doing, you know, youth case number one, like just help me shake out all that  from my life, work and personal.

And I think the third might be like to continue to celebrate the examples where it's the combination of... Of the person and AI that's doing something that's extraordinary, not just like, hey, look what AI did for me, or we don't need to do this anymore because we can just do it over here.

To me, that would be the biggest opportunity, is that last one. Great answer.

[@1:12:22](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4342.43) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Great answer. Last section is the evolve stage, strategic vision and thought leadership. Going back to your competitors, who would you name as your most three, sorry, name your three most AI advanced competitors.

What specifically are they doing that concerns you?

[@1:12:56](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4376.17) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Um, look, I don't, I don't like, don't Great Track down to the, like, I don't even really know who are, I would say agencies like us.

So I'll use one as proxy, like this company that actually is a great opportunity for partnership. You know, two years ago, they looked a whole lot more like us.

They were a little bit more on like the product and technical side. So websites, apps and stuff, but they're doing a lot of, you know, creative and UI work.

And they pivoted to like 100% AI consultancy. And so I don't want to do that, but like we've always seen engineering as sort of commoditized and that we would assemble the right skilled engineering teams for the right client context.

[@1:13:49](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4429.43) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

This is different.

[@1:13:50](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4430.65) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

This needs to be, it's not engineering in my mind, right? So that's one. And I would say the. I say the.

The other risk is big competitors and then software companies like Salesforce or whatever that just have – they're bringing forth technical solutions plus advisory and consulting, and then they start to – it's like CX.

When did CX become the domain of consultancies? That was always an agency domain. That's a risk, I think, is because they're going to be so strong in the other domains.

Then they step into yours. Perfect example, DirecTV, incomes to the marketing group like IBM, and they're putting in this agentic backbone.

Their first two use cases are so marketing domain-specific, and they have no business being in that conversation, but they are in that conversation.

And that's what the reality is is now We have to go spend the time with them to give them all the domain-specific context.

That's a big risk, I think, for us, too. When the topic of AI outweighs the domain craft in any, like accounting and finance, marketing, building physical products, retail fashion design, like AI-strong companies that don't have those domain skills, I think, are a risk to all those types of companies, and we're clearly in that spot.

[@1:15:42](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4542.29) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If we surveyed your clients about whether you're an AI leader or laggard compared to other agencies and consultancies, what would they honestly say?

[@1:15:51](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4551.97) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I think it would depend on the type of client. We have two buckets that I'll put that in. I would say our...

Our, you know, performance marketing, like high campaign driven, you know, agency clients might give us a, you know, either I don't know and I don't care because they just produce the work or a low score.

I think our advisory clients would rate us pretty highly because they actually really don't know that we're, because there's only a few of us, right, working in that space.

[@1:16:35](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4595.35) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Mm hmm.

[@1:16:37](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4597.07) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

It's almost like our personal adoption is proxy for the company. Right. So they sort of think like, well, Matt and Boris and got like, they're pretty  switched on.

They're bringing us all this thinking like they must be like really good at that as a company. But obviously, like that's not not not the case.

[@1:16:58](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4618.25) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I feel like you've answered this. in some ways already, but I'm going to ask it, and if you want to add anything, go ahead.

What AI development in the next 18 months could fundamentally disrupt your business model? For example, if a competitor launched an AI service tomorrow that made your core offering 50% faster and 30% cheaper, how quickly could you respond, and what would block you?

[@1:17:34](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4654.59) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Well, don't think we could respond very quickly right now. I think we're starting to get organized around, like, man, this one I think about a ton.

We're about to put a lot of effort, right, into creating a better, like, agency and advisory, like, company. I'm wondering, like, is that even a thing five years from now, at least the way that we understand it, right?

Like, are we trying to perfect, you know, something that won't need perfection at some point? Or are there going to be, like, universal truths about what we do, even though we might do it, you know, completely differently, which that's fine.

I'd prefer that, right? Like, we're in the business of creating awareness for something and affinity and a decision. I don't see that changing in the world.

So maybe we're okay. But I think we need to be honest with ourselves. And, like, this isn't, like, you know, smoothing out the edges and getting a little more efficient.

I think there's, that's a step to some thing that I personally haven't had. come into focus for me, but I know that we need to be talking about it and keeping an eye on it.

[@1:19:10](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4750.11) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

As AI handles more analytical and routine work, what uniquely human value does GlueIQ bring that becomes more important?

[@1:19:27](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4767.33) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Um, uh, critical thinking, inquiry, like I was saying, like that sort of dialogue that I've been exploring, um, you know, I don't, like from what I've seen to date, right?

Like it's, it's mimicry at a scale that we've never seen before, but I haven't seen any, you know, radically new, you know, generation from AI yet.

And so I think, you know, pulling out all of that off away from the idea people, the critical thinkers, the, you know, and we've got some of those.

That's, I forget the exact question, but like, to me, that's the piece that we still bring to the table, both in my business and elsewhere.

[@1:20:28](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4828.35) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Awesome, man. This was fantastic. I have three quick little wrap-ups here to bring us to a close. What's an uncomfortable truth about GlueIQ's AI transformation that everybody knows, but no one says out loud?

[@1:20:56](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4856.39) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Thank you. Thank Thank you. Thank That Well, Come I mean, I guess I would, that we don't really have a plan.

And I would say, it's not that no one says it out loud. Like, I just think we've been ignoring it, ignoring the need to take a disciplined approach.

Yeah.

[@1:21:18](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4878.57) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And what's the one thing that we must address in the next 90 days, or it will derail kind of the AI transformation and pass forward?

If had to pick one thing to address as urgent in the next 90 days, what would it be?

[@1:21:35](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4895.37) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Just a plan. And an investment. Right? We can't waste. I think we know enough now. Right? Plus, just know that, like, can't be ignored anymore.

That, like, we just need plan and resources. And then, you know, discipline. And last but not least.

[@1:22:00](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4920.01) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

At what surprised you most about our conversation today?

[@1:22:17](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4937.03) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

I don't think anything surprised me. I'm actually, like, I enjoy that, like, as much as I've been thinking about this, your line of questioning, like, took my brain into some mentally unexplored places, and I can see why.

So I think just the, like I said, not surprised. I would say more, like, pleased on the breadth that we covered in a relatively short amount of time.

And thinking about things that, you know, as an offering that I'm not thinking about yet. For Glue and our company, would actually, I would actually say the thing, the thing that surprised me is, like, while I've been thinking all these thoughts, to actually.

answer the questions all at once. It's kind of depressing how far behind we are. That would be surprising. That hard look via the questions, it's like, wow, .

We're behind. I appreciate it, man.

[@1:23:19](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=4999.35) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, I'm kidding. I'll call out end of interview for the transcript. But I think you yourself are, I would say you're ahead.

I would absolutely say you're ahead. I wouldn't say you're on par. I think your devotion and dedication to thinking about these things is really clear.

And, you know, it's, it's, the playing field is changing. What I think you feel that I think a lot of organizations would feel if they answered the question similar.

it's, it's, It's not that, oh , we're screwed. It's more the time is now. think that's it because I think there's enough.

I mean, it's still only three years since ChatGPT launched, right? So not even three. And you are seeing that so many organizations are spending money hand over fist on investing in AI and their investments aren't working.

And my hope, again, is to build something that creates the right culture, frameworks, use cases, coaching, behaviors for the kind of adoption that's needed.

And, you know, what I always think about, and I have presentations, I'm doing one at FAU next week and the week after, sorry, this week and the week after.

But one of my pieces of content is just kind of talking about what it means. to live through the fastest rate of change in human history.

[@1:25:03](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=5103.45) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Yep, again, and even faster than ever before. Dude, I want to talk more about this with you. Yeah, yeah.

Go, go.

[@1:25:09](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=5109.99) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Matt, this was great. Thank you. Thank you so much, brother. All right. get together soon.

[@1:25:14](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=5114.51) - **Matt Kujawa (GlueIQ)**

Keep in touch with me when you get back. Done.

[@1:25:17](https://fathom.video/calls/460221396?timestamp=5117.57) - **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

All right, man.
