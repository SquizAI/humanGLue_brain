---

## Part 2: The Agreement

### Settlement of Accrued Work (400+ Hours)

The value of work already completed (~$140,000 - $220,000) is exchanged for:

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Vehicle Purchase** | Company purchases vehicle at mutually agreed price |
| **Vehicle Use** | CTO drives vehicle while contributing to HumanGlue |
| **Ownership Transfer** | Vehicle ownership transfers to CTO at $1M revenue milestone |

This arrangement:
- Settles the significant value already delivered
- Preserves company cash during growth phase
- Creates aligned incentive toward revenue goal
- Provides tangible benefit to CTO immediately

---

### Ongoing Development Commitment

**From now until $1M revenue:**

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Minimum Hours** | 20 hours per week |
| **Work Allocation** | At CTO's discretion |
| **Scope** | Platform development, maintenance, strategic technical decisions |
| **Cash Compensation** | Deferred until $1M milestone |

The CTO determines where development time is best spent, including:
- New feature development
- Bug fixes and maintenance
- Infrastructure and security
- Third-party integrations
- Technical architecture decisions
- Performance optimization

**This ensures the platform continues advancing toward revenue-generating capability.**

---

### $1M Revenue Milestone

**When HumanGlue reaches $1M revenue, the following triggers occur:**

| Event | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Vehicle Ownership** | Transfers fully to CTO |
| **Compensation Model** | Transitions to Founders Contract |
| **Rate** | Market rate ($550/hr) |
| **Payment** | If company can afford: paid immediately |
| | If company cannot afford: deferred until cash flow supports |

This creates a clean transition:
- **Pre-$1M:** Equity + vehicle arrangement (sweat equity model)
- **Post-$1M:** Cash compensation at market rates (sustainable model)

---

### Equity Stake

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Equity Percentage** | 25% |
| **Vesting Trigger** | 1-year anniversary of agreement |
| **Transfer** | Full 25% transfers at 1-year point |

#### Why 25% Equity?

| Role | Typical Equity |
|------|----------------|
| Technical co-founder | 20-50% |
| CTO (early stage) | 5-15% |
| First engineer | 1-5% |
| **This agreement** | **25%** |

This reflects a **technical co-founder** relationship:
- The platform IS the business
- No platform = no HumanGlue
- CTO has been and continues to be essential to success
- Aligned long-term incentives

---

### Post-Agreement: Ongoing Support

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Services** | Technical support, maintenance, enhancements |
| **Rate** | Market rate ($550/hr or as negotiated) |
| **Scope** | As needed by the business |

After the initial commitment period, continued technical work happens at market rates, ensuring ongoing platform development and support.

## Part 5: Market Context

### What This Would Cost Otherwise

| Approach | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| In-house CTO salary | $250,000 - $400,000 + benefits |
| Development team (3-4 people) | $500,000 - $800,000/year |
| Development agency | $150,000 - $300,000/year |

### What HumanGlue Is Getting

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| 20 hrs/week x 52 weeks x $550/hr | **$572,000/year** market value |
| Actual cash outlay pre-$1M | **Vehicle cost only** |
| Effective discount | **~95%** |

---

## Part 6: Key Terms Summary

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Accrued work settlement** | Vehicle purchase + CTO use rights |
| **Vehicle transfer trigger** | $1M revenue |
| **Minimum weekly hours** | 20 hours |
| **Work allocation** | CTO discretion |
| **Equity stake** | 25% |
| **Equity vesting** | 1-year cliff |
| **Post-$1M compensation** | Market rate ($550/hr) |
| **Post-$1M payment** | Paid if affordable, deferred if not |
| **Ongoing support (post-agreement)** | Market rate |

---

## Part 7: Next Steps

1. **Confirm vehicle details** - Make, model, agreed purchase price
2. **Formalize written agreement** - Legal documentation of all terms
3. **Establish agreement start date** - Begins 1-year vesting clock
4. **Define revenue tracking** - How $1M milestone is measured (ARR, MRR, gross revenue)
5. **Create Founders Contract template** - For post-$1M transition

---

## The Bottom Line

**This is not a proposal. This is the agreed structure.**

The platform already built is worth $140,000 - $220,000 (conservatively). Replacing it would cost $500,000 - $800,000 and take 12-18 months.

The person who built it:
- Understands every line of code
- Knows every business decision behind it
- Can iterate 10x faster than a new team
- Is committed to HumanGlue's success through meaningful equity

**This structure ensures HumanGlue has world-class technical leadership while preserving cash for growth.**

When HumanGlue hits $1M, everyone wins.
