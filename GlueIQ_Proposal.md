# HumanGlue Adaptability Assessment
## Transformation Readiness Evaluation for GlueIQ

### Executive Summary

Before GlueIQ can guide others through AI transformation, you need to understand your own readiness. Our $25,000 Adaptability Assessment evaluates your organization across three critical dimensions—People, Process, and Tech/Tools—providing the insights and credibility you need to lead in the AI era.

This assessment serves three purposes:
1. **Internal Diagnostic**: Understand GlueIQ's true transformation readiness
2. **Client Qualification**: Determine if GlueIQ meets our partner criteria
3. **Service Foundation**: Experience the assessment you'll offer to your clients

The outcome: A comprehensive readiness evaluation, strategic roadmap, and—if qualified—the opportunity to offer this powerful tool to your clients as a certified HumanGlue partner.
