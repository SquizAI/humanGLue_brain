## 🎓 **Key Lessons for Success**

1. **Start With Services, Not Platform**
   - Manual delivery teaches you what customers actually need
   - You can charge more for white-glove
   - Build platform only after you've done it 10+ times manually

2. **One Customer Is Worth 100 Features**
   - Don't build features hoping people will come
   - Find 1 customer, make them wildly successful
   - Ask them what they need next

3. **Consistency > Perfection**
   - Better to do 10 outreach messages per week for 12 weeks
   - Than to do 100 messages once and burn out

4. **Talk to Customers Every Week**
   - Sales calls
   - Customer check-ins
   - Informal chats
   - You learn more in conversations than dashboards

5. **Revenue Solves Everything**
   - $1K/month proves the concept
   - $5K/month funds your time
   - $10K/month lets you hire help
   - Focus on revenue, not vanity metrics
