[@0:15](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=15.68) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

So we were just talking about Fathom. So were just talking about Fathom. So we So we Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome to Thank you. Good morning, sir. How are you? How are you doing?

[@6:10](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=370.68) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I'm great.

[@6:12](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=372.02) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

I'm great. I am ready to dive right in if you are.

[@6:21](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=381.54) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Do it. All right.

[@6:24](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=384.36) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Okay. So welcome to the human... So one note I'll say to you, if you have notes along the way, I'd love your feedback at the end.

But if you want to just jot them down or make a note, and then we can address everything at the end.

Sound good? Yes, sir. Perfect. Okay. So welcome to the Human Glue Reality Gap Assessment. The purpose of this is to evaluate your AI and adaptability strategy and assess the gaps across the LT.

am binge discuss the있 the And your employee base. So appreciate you taking the time. The focus here is going through four question segments that unlock through our Glue framework, G for growth, individual skill building and confidence development, leverage, how we leverage AI tool mastery and value creation, unite social learning, cultural and organizational change, and how do we evolve ongoing organizational development and thought leadership.

And I'm particularly interested in your candid responses on what's working, what's not, and where you see the gaps. There are no wrong answers.

And everything is confidential and will be aggregated to create insights, not to evaluate individuals. So first question is, before we dive into AI specifically, can you tell me about a time when GlueIQ successfully rolled out a new technology across?

What's the organization? And what made that adoption work or not work?

[@8:09](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=489.61) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Great question. I think historically we have had challenges in rolling out new platforms. From day one, that's been really, really challenging.

I think part of it having to do with we have a lot of senior professionals that are used to working in their environment and don't adapt to change very, very well.

That said, the last implementation, the last two implementations that we have had have gone quite well. And and I believe that the reason that they've gone well.

Well, is that we kind of burned all boats and were somewhat draconian around allowing exceptions. So it's kind of like, you know, you don't like pizza, which is a messed up thing to say because everybody, whatever, but it's like, you know, you don't like to eat broccoli.

Well, the only thing we have to eat is broccoli. So, you know, and that has worked. It doesn't feel great, but it is effective.

It has been effective. Great.

[@9:36](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=576.781) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

That's really helpful. I want to ask you about your personal AI usage. Can you walk me through the tools that you used yesterday or this week in your actual work and what you use them for?

[@9:50](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=590.261) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Well, I'm really excited about the Atlas browser, like really excited about the Atlas browser. excited it. I'm I'm I'm

So AI tools that I use, you know, I use obviously ChatGPT, Perplexity, CoPilot, I use Motion, I use, well, I'm playing with Claude, I use Beautiful AI, Gamma, Midjourney, I use something else called Fixer AI.

And then some N8N, a bunch of other stuff. So I'm constantly playing, constantly playing with things. As you know, I've tried to do sort of Claude code, but that's not going very well.

I need a refresher on that whole thing. Not going very well yet.

[@11:00](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=660.001) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

But it will. What would you say is the most sophisticated thing you've done with AI that actually surprised you based on the result you got?

[@11:13](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=673.541) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I think it, well, two things. I look at it, how do step back? I think that I started using AI as a sounding board and something that I could challenge, sort of like as a co-pilot, the augmented, you know, augmentation stuff.

I think I use that pretty deeply, and I have a pretty good sense of prompt engineering, and I geek out on that stuff, and I'm learning a lot more about that.

So I use it all the time from that perspective. Now, where has it And you know, and you get surprised and delighted and frustrated every day.

I think the most recent thing that I did, that I was kind of like, oh, , was, was some, like, agent, you know, stuff.

And like the co-brows, and that's why I'm so, like, the whole, I would, the story I told you yesterday on, on, you know, like, doing my expense report, you know, like, or, or company expenses, and something that used to take me a few hours, took me a few minutes, and that was pretty cool.

So that, that would be it. That's great.

[@12:42](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=762.521) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

And if you had to put a thumb in the air percentage on it, how much more productive would you say you are with AI tools?

[@12:52](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=772.621) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

It's got to be a minimum of 40%. Like, you know, it definitely, it's probably. I'm a multiplier, but I would say, you know, to be conservative, I think it's probably 40%.

I don't get enough heads-down space to work. You know, I'm in a lot of meetings and a lot of, you know, like a lot of like human interactions during the day, which is great, but like heads-down getting to work, I think that's where I really get the most out of it.

[@13:27](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=807.001) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

And do you find yourself using AI tools more for work or more for home and personal tasks?

[@13:37](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=817.781) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

If I knew the difference between those two things, I could answer the question, but it definitely is work. do all my tools work.

[@13:45](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=825.381) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Yeah.

[@13:47](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=827.061) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

You know, they haven't figured out AI for phishing yet. Yet.

[@13:52](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=832.981) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

If you could have an AI expert sit with you for two hours to teach you one thing about AI, no one else.

Watching, what would you want to learn?

[@14:04](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=844.541) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Really great question. This is going to sound awful. There's all this swirl around AI employees, you know, and I think that is a very gross overstatement, you know?

I think it's more around very specific processes, but not really, you know, an AI employee. I think that if someone can sit with me and make me see something I haven't seen there yet, that lives up to, you know, even a small part of that promise that's out there, that would really, uh, excite me.

Excite me. Not, not because I want to display. But rather, I want to be able to scale the business without, you know, hiring so many more people.

That's a great answer.

[@15:07](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=907.601) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

But I don't buy it yet.

[@15:08](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=908.621) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I don't buy it yet. I want to buy it.

[@15:12](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=912.601) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

And when you want to learn something new with AI or figure out how to do something with AI, where do you typically go to get that knowledge?

[@15:23](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=923.921) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

YouTube University. Mm-hmm.

[@15:29](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=929.781) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Can you tell me about the last time AI actually changed your mind about a business decision? What was the situation and what did AI reveal to you that was unseen?

[@15:45](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=945.221) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Ooh. I guess I'm at the point that that happens a lot, actually, which is a good thing. The last...

Last time, it was not a great scenario, but basically AI alerted me on some revenue dropping out of the forecast that I had not seen, and I was able to chase down the information and do something about it.

I think that was a pretty big deal. It's a trivial thing, but it was just a, you know, really, it was an important thing.

[@16:34](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=994.261) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

You are using AI a lot. In terms of your own self-assessment, when you compare yourself to other executives, you know, in similar roles, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency?

Do you consider yourself ahead, behind, or on par?

[@16:55](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1015.04) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I think if I was an executive in a tech... company, I'm probably way behind where I should be. As an agency or consulting owner, my ambition always trumps my achievement, so I think I'm probably 80% of where I should be.

You know, compared to, I don't know, a law firm or somebody else, then probably, you know, way, way, way ahead, right?

So I think it's more par for the course, and I think this is a difficult course to learn, that I play on.

[@17:40](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1060.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Let's pivot to assessing AI talent within GlueIQ. If I had to ask you to list your top five AI fluent people in the organization right now, not by title, but by capability, who are they and what makes them stand out?

[@18:07](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1087.72) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

So I think, I think, want me to tell you people, right? So I think Casey, who's like a creative director, has real, he's very talented as it relates to film.

So he's been playing with generative AI and specifically around kind of video motion edit, you know, like that kind of stuff.

And the guy just has like real personal passion for it. And I think it's positively infecting, you know, some of his folks.

So it's very narrow, but very deep. That's what I would say. And on the, like, so he's the. You know, Matt, for sure, but again, he's very focused on DevOps and sort of MarTech ad tech, right?

So he's more around, like, how, you know, how you get to a point where the majority of your code is written by AI and is being checked by AI and workflows related to that.

So I think he's very focused on that. So that's two. A third one would be , which is really interesting.

He's a kind of, he's a sort of middle, you know, he's not a director. He's kind of like a senior associate or manager level person that does a lot of, like, the creative.

And what I really value about him is he's kind of like a pixel-perfect designer, sort of like a Cobb-type person, but they do a ton of grunt work, and I think he's got sort of an engineering mindset.

And what I really value, I'll tell you what I really value. So we do something here. I know I've to stick to the program here, but we do this thing we call GlueU every other Tuesday, right?

And the format is we literally pull people out of a hat, and they know that Tuesday the 17th, it's Alex's turn, right?

And they're supposed to come and present something to the agency, the whole agency. It's like an all-agency thing that they think is valuable.

And it could be anything. could be. They're a passion project. could be about anything. It doesn't matter. And then we do this, like, 20 things you didn't know about me.

Sometimes it's a new hire, but sometimes it's people that have been here before. So we have this format that we do every other Tuesday.

We've been doing it since the beginning, and it's sort of, you know, kind of a ritual. This Tuesday, it was .

His name's Juan, but it was 's turn. And his English is not great, right? It's really, really not great, but he's a crazy smart guy, right?

And so he did a presentation on generative AI and how he uses it in his journey. One of the things that was really cool about it is that he basically said, look, I started, you know, he's probably in his early or mid-40s, right?

And he's like, you know, I started when we were working with film. And then, you know, I... Then there was the digital revolution, and then there was UX and AI.

And he had this very interesting sort of take to it, basically saying, like, you know, I've been a designer my entire life, and I've seen all of these changes, and this won't be the last.

You know, this isn't the first, and it won't be the last, and you've got to keep up with your craft.

So that's really the attitude, and the stuff that he was showing was very, very specific. So that's four. I'll tack on to that.

So the other one was two, we hired, we do this internship program with Orange Umbrella, which is the UM's kind of internal agency program, right?

And we've had a really great, we've had a really great level of success in terms of, you know, the interns that we have.

So And it, Thank Over the summer, you know, we hire, you know, a good 75% of them, you know, 80% of them, which is unheard of, right?

So we've had a really good thing. There's this young woman, her name is Angie, who had come recommended, she was like the lead PM for very sort of operational, very structured, very disciplined person that was there.

And she's come in, she works in like our agency ops team, and is doing a bunch of stuff. What was really interesting in her 20 things you didn't know about me, I learned that she races cars, and that she is an AI instructor, you know, and does this, you know, at the university and all this stuff.

So she had like this real kind of deep, you know, passion. That's understanding around AI that is outside of her work here at Glue.

And then so through that GlueU, I was like, so how do I get you more involved in what we're trying to do?

And we just started to do that. I think that's for who else? You know, I just think a lot of the juniors that have come in, you know, just naturally use tools the way we use tools, you know, it's just kind of their thing.

So that injection of kind of young talent is also, I would say that that's not a person, but maybe I'll add a name to one.

Murphy is one of them. She's a writer that came in for Moritz Umbrella, and it's just like, it's very matter-of-fact that she uses AI for everything, you know?

Yeah. So that answers your question, right? Yeah, and it's really helpful and it's great context.

[@25:07](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1507.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

And related to that, do you have today an AI upskilling program, budget, that you can talk about how many folks, what the investment looks like, and what outcomes you're measuring?

[@25:27](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1527.12) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

The answer is no. It's not formalized at all, right? So there isn't an office of AI or a task force or any of that stuff.

We're a relatively small company. think what we've been – look, the irony there is that you know that we do consulting around this stuff, and the first thing we tell people is that you should do that, right?

So we've been actively discussing, we have one of two people, Angie being one of them. Where our thought process is to create kind of this office of AI, or even like an AI help desk, where the previous question, you were like, if somebody would sit with you and show you how to do something, what would it be?

Is we want to do a couple of things. One is make sure that we empower everybody that have access to all the tools.

Yeah. Right. Do that in a way that we, you know, manage, you know, kind of privacy and security and all the stuff that we have in our MSAs with our clients.

So we have, you know, an enterprise open AI license, and we have Copilot and Microsoft and, you know, some of the basic stuff for augmentation.

And, you know, we're encouraging people to do that. One of the tools, which is a beautiful AI for like deck creation and all that stuff, that when I was telling you earlier about kind of burning the boats, is...

Sometimes if I see somebody showing me a PowerPoint presentation, they're going to hear it from me. If somebody fires up Google Slides, which happens all the time, they're going to hear it from me.

So in some cases, it's a mandate. So I think we've invested a fair amount of money in tools, but really not training beyond the GlueU thing that I was telling you.

So a couple of months ago, I did what every other CEO has done and written their sort of version of that.

I'm trying to remember what the company was, the first guy that did it. Shopify or whatever, that it's like, you know, AI skills are expected and required, you know, and that you cannot opt in or opt out of this .

Like you got to, you know, it's like we're doing it, you know. You're coming along with us or see it, right?

So I can share that note with you. It's what people have done. And then one of the things that we did as part of that is, A, we made sure that everyone was provisioned with the right stuff, made some kind of mandates around certain tool usage by sunsetting things that didn't have kind of co-pilot capability.

And then we switched the GlueU to only be about AI. So the subject is really about their usage or bringing ideas to the table.

Where could your colleagues and the company and our clients benefit from it? So we've been creating focus. We haven't had a lot of money to invest.

You know, we were sort of digging out of a pretty challenging 2024\. And now we're in a... In a relatively good place, but so it isn't super formal, but it is pervasive, right?

Like, I don't think it's, you know, just little side projects here and there. think we're trying to get our head around it.

[@29:15](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1755.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Would you say, is there a percentage you would attribute to how many folks are genuinely AI capable today within the org?

[@29:32](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1772.0) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

It's probably 30%, you know, I may be pleasantly surprised, but I'm going to say, I'm going to say 30%.

I look at tool usage a lot. Like, I get reports on all of this stuff, and it's like, I think, you know, with very few exceptions, everyone is using it.

The question is, are they using it regularly? So if I go in and I'm like, all right, well, Sally, I'm making hope we don't have Sally, but like the last time Sally, you know, used ChatGPT was October 17th and we're on the 29th.

She's not an avid user, right? So we're looking at it from that perspective. I can see, like I can see the people that are using stuff all the time and then folks that, you know, are, they're just sort of touching the base to, you know, have to go and collect in their $200.

They're not actually playing the game, right? So there's a lot of that, I think.

[@30:47](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1847.38) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Can you tell me about the last time you lost a person to a competitor? Did AI skills factor into their departure?

And what about your last, I was going to say, what about your last hire? Did you have to pay a premium for AI skills on your last hire?

[@31:18](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1878.64) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

No, but I don't think that that's representative of reality, right? So my experiences don't dictate what the reality is either, right?

So no, it was like, for example, I think that the last batch of hires were, you know, four, five juniors that we hired from Orange Umbrella.

I think all of them came in with AI skills and their entry level conversions, right? So they're, you know, sort of bringing in young talent that is more.

You can't call them AI natives, but just more AI fluent, didn't come at a premium. That's just like, you know, so that from that perspective.

I don't know. I got to tell you that I would be highly suspect of someone that's coming in October 29th of 2025 as a self-proclaimed AI expert, that person is so full of , right?

[@32:39](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1959.6) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, yeah.

[@32:41](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=1961.42) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

So, you know, do they exist? Are they like the Maddies of the world and stuff like that? So Luke, but there's not.

And if anything, I think that we've had this conversation before. Or, like, when I just went down the list of the four or five people, know

that are really strong. It may be deeper, but still narrow. No one's looking at the whole field and saying, like, AI, where are the opportunities in terms of efficiency gains or elevating the work or sort of augmentative versus agentic versus generative?

Like, I would be very suspect of anyone that's orchestrating all of that stuff. I know you need to do it, but I think that's a team sport.

I don't think that's an individual, right? Like, not saying that those individuals don't exist, but it's not a common thing, and I think they're all going to skew to some.

It's like, we talked about this before, where I was like, it's kind of like mobile strategy in the, you know, early 2000s.

Thank Right? If you were a champion of mobility and you were in HR, then it's going to do a certain thing.

If you're a champion of that and you're in marketing, then you're going to have a really strong strategy around, like, you know, location-based, you know, targeting and like that, but not necessarily around service and support.

Right? So it's like AI is like one of those things. It's like strategy. Right? You know, so like what kind of strategy do you know?

I'm a strategist. Well, are you a brand strategist? Are you like, what are your skills? Right? So it's just, it's such a broad subject.

Right? That it is kind of anybody that says they know it all. I think that's a red flag.

[@34:55](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2095.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I would, I would agree with you. I just want to make sure. George, how are you for time?

[@35:01](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2101.44) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Because there's a bunch more to get.

[@35:03](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2103.16) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

I'm I'm good. I do have a, yeah.

[@35:08](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2108.28) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I'm good. Okay.

[@35:11](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2111.38) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Looking out 18 months, what AI capabilities does the organization need that you definitely don't have today, and how are you planning to close the gap?

Great question.

[@35:38](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2138.6) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

There's a, you know, there's a couple of tracks, right? And I think that we're at different levels of maturity along each one of those tracks, right?

I think for me, the, I don't know, I haven't thought about this, so I'm like doing this kind of on the fly.

you. Um, I think, I think there's the sort of, you know, making our human superhuman from an ideation and from like concept strategy development, planning, that kind of stuff.

Right. And I think that, that, that is the one thing that needs to be just expected. Right. So I think all of our consultants, you know, should, should be, you know, uh, pretty well versed.

And, um, I saw, uh, uh, uh, yesterday, the day before yesterday. And he was like, what, what, what was the longest prompting exercise that you've had?

You know, like if you haven't spent 30 minutes, you know, or an hour, literally, going back and forth and, and, and sharpening ideas and doing all of that stuff.

Then you're not really, you know, like you're not really well versed. So for me, I feel like every single human that is in a delivery role, you know, a client facing role needs to get to that place.

And I think that there's where you're going to see it be quite lumpy in that there are a few folks, you know, me included, that are pretty deep in that, like you are, you know, like, so I think there's, and that needle is moving, you know, pretty consistently and in the right direction.

Right? So I think I think that's one track, right? That I guess your question was really like, what's the one thing that we don't have that we really have?

For me, momentum around workflow, automation and process is, is like, to really scale a business, if you need. It's like, how do you get C players to deliver A players?

And how do you create a system that when I'm not here, it continues to go? And I think that I read something the other day.

Somebody was like, run kind of business operations and scaling businesses that way. That it's like, if you don't have a system that you're building that you can just plug people into or plug clients into, and you're just really relying on a handful of really smart people to kind of get through it, then this is not a business, it's a hostage situation, that's somebody told me, right?

And that really sort of hit. So I'm like, . So I feel that at a company that's going to be seven years old, we don't have enough scaffolding and infrastructure from a process.

And I really think that some of us led by me is not, like, I think I'm a pretty good strategist.

I think I'm a pretty, I'm pretty good at a few things. But from an operations standpoint, that's a place where I really need to grow.

And I see AI, you know, I've been like, how do I get people around me that are more wired into these sort of systems thinkers and, and get something out of building these systems.

And for me, AI, you know, some of the unlocks have been around like process mapping and like that, that it's boring.

Some of the really, really boring things that we avoid, that are foundational are really great. So for me, I think that, that anything around workflow automation and, and, and almost like SOPs and stuff like that is, is probably the biggest gain that we would have and the biggest gap.

And I can give you some clues. Let's take Maggie's team that you're working with on this whole thing. That business is running really, really great.

She's hitting all her targets. We're profitable. I think employee sat is great. There's a good vibe and culture. The work is getting good or whatever.

But if I have any criticism, and I do, and I tell her, there's really two places that that business needs to, for us to get to where we want to be, we need to fluff up.

Right? One is adopting modern ways of working. In other words, we have a lot of PMs and account folks and whatever, but I don't see a lot of project plans.

I don't see things broken down into task. I don't see whatever. It's just kind of like, you know, Sally is in charge of delivering this.

So it's very almost like high-level milestone things, and people do their thing and get it done. But it isn't structured at a level of fidelity where you can really start to apply automation and things like that, right?

So lots of meetings. Project management happens by meetings and emails. You know, there isn't, like, workflow stuff, right? And then there's been a bunch of hurdles, and you asked a question earlier around, like, you know, platform or tech adoption where we've had, you know, real failures.

We're on our third agency management system and still haven't extracted the value that it promises. And a lot of it has been that people are so busy being busy that they don't do the foundational boring part, right?

So there's a place where... Like, even her team. I had to actually cut off, because we moved from G Suite to Microsoft two years ago, and probably a third of her team was still, like, using Google Slides with clients and like that, and having two different accounts and moving back and forth.

Like, I literally had to turn it off. So that team is effective, but I think old school in the way they work.

So there's a real, you know, so it's kind of this thing of, like, why fix it if it ain't broke?

Because there's other areas that need a lot more attention. Well, that part of the business is growing, is steady, or whatever, and that's probably where there's gold in them, their hills, right?

And I don't think they don't see the, I don't know that they clearly see the need to change. It's they're having success, but I'll tell you that the way that they're scaling is not sustainable, right?

So there's places where you're like, hey, your revenue goals are going up, but you're not going to get more people.

So you have to embrace these tools because you're not going to get more people. And again, a little bit draconian, but I think that's part of the challenge there.

Awesome. That was a last answer, and I think it was very political because I don't know if I gave you the right answer.

No, it's good.

[@43:36](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2616.67) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

That's good. So we finished up the growth segment. We're moving on to leverage, and we're going to dive into financial impact and ROI modeling.

So I would love to understand from your perspective how you're measuring ROI on AI investments, and what is the framework and the metrics that you're using?

[@44:13](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2653.57) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Also not as structured as it should be because it's kind of early days, but the way I would look at it is I think I'm looking at quality of deliverables, speed to response, and like speed to market, and I'm still, I mean, I kind of look into billable utilization too because like this year we've been able to grow revenue significantly, in other words, like let's say on a scale of 1 to 10, our revenue growth is a 7\.

Our staff growth is a one or two. So we've been able to improve. We got to a point where our margins weren't worth it.

So we've been able to improve margin, grow the top line, but really control our labor costs. So I look at that for sure.

Because we're a people-based business. So if we make people more productive, more effective, it's very easy to measure.

[@45:28](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2728.34) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Do you have a best AI ROI example from a particular tool or initiative that you would think? I think it's a real base.

[@45:37](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2737.21) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I think the kind of deck creation, right? I mean, I think the amount of time you've done it too, being a consultant, the amount of time that you spend producing decks is significant.

And that's a place where, you know, done right, you can. You could make much better work, faster, consistent. You know, it almost becomes kind of like a knowledge management system, right?

Because even people trying to find, you know, there's a deck that I did for this client three years ago, and it's in this folder, and like, oh, we have, you know, this is our third agency management system.

And is this in Google or is it in Teams? And, you know, like, can I need to look at old Slack messages because we don't use Slack anymore?

We have, like, all of that . being able to have, you know, sort of reusable assets, you know, kind of a CMS for our deck, if you will, is fine.

And it would be like sometimes, like, we have a great client meeting, we have to get them a proposal.

And it's like, we get the proposal seven days later. Like, if you get the proposal to them two days later, your conversion rate goes.

Right? So just our ability to turn something around. So our team is, I mean, luckily they're like, look, this is not good enough.

We've got to get it great before we put it in front of the client. I can appreciate that as opposed to just mailing it in.

But, you know, taking a week and a half to get someone to someone, you know, get a proposal back to somebody, they may have moved on or there's a bigger emergency this week and you don't close the deal.

Yeah.

[@47:32](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2852.43) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. So that to me is the biggest unlock, you know. Is there a particular tool or AI initiative that you guys invested in but ultimately abandoned?

And if so, can you tell me a little bit about what happened and what you learned from that experience?

[@47:51](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2871.39) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Oh, yeah. I think that we've invested in a couple of... Of supposedly fit-for-purpose Gen.A.I. platforms for like, hey, you create 300 banner ads, you know, this thing can create it for you, just feed it some information and it does all of that stuff.

And it just didn't work for a couple of reasons. One is that it just, these things are not ready for prime time, and then the quality of the output doesn't justify the premium for having an agent.

Like, I'll give you an example. Like, I know you like Notion for project management, and you create these Notion pages with emojis and all that .

I think if you're a startup person and you're doing whatever it is, it's actually quite, very useful. I can't use that with a client.

It comes across as being super JV, right? So I feel like some of these tools make it sound like creativity and taste and style is easy.

So I think it's when you don't have enough control over the output and it's clearly, you know, some of these things are design programs created by engineers that by design don't have a design sense.

Makes it tricky.

[@49:50](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2990.89) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

You know what I'm saying?

[@49:52](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=2992.15) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

It's like, it's like, here's a bulldozer so that you can deal with your bonsai. Yeah. I like that.

[@50:05](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3005.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

I like that metaphor, too. If your board or investors challenge your AI investments tomorrow, saying prove this is worth it, what evidence would you show them?

And what question would you hope they don't ask?

[@50:31](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3031.45) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

So I think just giving our structure and whatever, I feel like this is probably like the money question whenever you do these with other executives.

I think it's less relevant to us, right? But because I think that on the first part of the question is if you would...

You would need to be living under a rock to not know that our business, both the agency and consulting business, is going to and is being highly disrupted by this.

So this is like, you know that there's a hurricane coming, and you choose not to put your shutters up, right?

So to not do this is irresponsible, right? Where I feel like in other boards, is there still the, is it worth it?

Should we fast follow? Should we let others experiment and then do something? Should we wait until we get the sort of enterprise grade where they're solving some of the security challenges?

You know, how do we, they have different pressures and different things that are coming out. With us, it's like, there is no doubt that the hurricane is coming.

And you better board up your windows, right? Like there is no doubt, right? So you have to do that from that perspective.

The thing that I would not want them to know is that a big part of our value proposition is helping clients future-proof their business.

It's our job to look around the corners and see what's coming and provide that sort of stewardship role that we have with clients.

So are we walking the walk and talking the talk? I think that's part of the thing where we're literally going in and designing organization, operating models, workflows, tech stacks for clients to basically sort of future-proof.

And, and, and, and, And employ modern sort of workflows and tools. Yet our agency business isn't there yet, as I mentioned earlier.

So that to me is one of those things where it's like you got to fake it till you make it.

But we have to take advantage of it. Now, the good news is we have a growing profitable business with happy clients.

But because they don't know what they don't know yet. You know, like there's real. So I feel we need to look.

I've said this before. In the agency business, there are sometimes your capabilities exceed your reputation. And sometimes your reputation exceeds your capability.

And almost never is the moon. We're in a moment in time where we have more credibility than we have capability, and we have to catch up to our own reputation on some of this stuff so we can take advantage of the moment, right?

So that's the thing that I wouldn't want the outside world to know, but I really need all my people to know, because it's almost like the more you are, the more likely somebody's going to embrace change.

If everything's going great, then people are going to really resist change, maybe, you know, culturally, who knows? This is what you're here to assess, right?

Yeah, but...

[@55:00](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3300.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Well, you teed us up perfectly for the next question, which is really around appetite for change. And so this is, on a scale of 1 to 10, how much energy do you feel GlueIQ has today for another transformation initiative?

[@55:38](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3338.37) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Oh, that's a complex question. I'm going to say that there's lots of excitement and appetite for it at face value, right?

But I think part of the challenge, I think... I think there's a generational – that's actually the wrong term.

There is a life stage factor to appetite for change, right? The better things are going for you, the more energy you spend on preserving that.

And by design, that creates headwind for evolution and for change. The less you have to lose and more you have to gain, the greater your appetite is, right?

So I feel like we have this double-edged sword that we deal with, that we have some pretty And and smart folks like, you know, a Joey, like a couple of our people are just like pros and cons in both sides of the , you know, ledger or whatever it is.

But it's like you're hard to press. You're hard to to find some people that have the experience and knowledge on some of this stuff.

And I'm not saying Joey is a problem here, but it's like those are the types that I actually see the biggest resistance for.

So you may be, it's like having, you know, a really incredible player that is really bad in the locker room.

And that creates a dilemma for any kind of organization, right? Because you're like, look, we want to play at this level.

Right. But we're also trying to build a legacy and a franchise. So how do you deal with the entitled superstars that don't think they need to do anything different in a world where that tip of the spear is really valuable because all of the long-tail stuff are the things that are getting automated and commoditized.

So it's a little bit of Sophie's Choice thing going on there.

[@58:36](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3516.59) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

No, there's nuance for sure, and I think you're spot on that appetite for change does reflect life stage comfortability, expertise, all of those things.

If you're able to kind of think holistically without kind of late. Fasering in on particular individuals' appetite or lack of appetite, what do you think could restore energy for change as a whole within GlueIQ?

[@59:15](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3555.75) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I mean, I think truth through proof, right? Like, I think it's, you see it and you're like, I want more of it.

Or you see somebody else do and you're like, how'd you do that? I need it. So I think the sort of osmosis that happens by having somebody that's having success sitting next to you with it and maybe it's keeping up with the Joneses, maybe it's intellectual curiosity, maybe it's any of those things.

But, you know, if you're sitting remote at home and you've been killing it and you feel like you're not spending any time upskilling yourself.

You're not, you're like, I'm good. You know, it's like climate change is somebody else's problem. I'll be dead before that happens.

Like that, no, I'm just saying like there's a lot of, you know, me, me, me people, you know.

[@1:00:18](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3618.43) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Let's talk about product and service evolution. Yep. What client deliverable or service have you fundamentally reimagined because of AI?

And can you walk me through that?

[@1:00:36](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3636.95) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I think the biggest one is performance analytics, right? I think it's one of the things that we have found to be very sticky and almost like if we were to, if you told me like pick one thing and stop doing everything else, I would almost lean.

to that, right? Because it's a great Trojan horse to everything else and all that. So we go in and we build these dashboards for clients to run their e-commerce business, to run all of this stuff or whatever.

Single source of truth. We don't let the agencies grade their own homework, all of that kind of stuff. And we've had a lot of success with these dashboards, right?

And frankly, we kind of sell them like hotcakes. What we started to do with AI is that the data layer to start to interpret that data and surface insights and alerts on changes in performance on any of that stuff.

So making the data actionable, but doing it at the data layer as opposed to at the presentation layer is something that would promote.

So from a tech development and investment would be a really big deal, and it's actually not a big deal, and it's changing the game on some of the stuff.

And I'm like, to the point where I'm almost like, let's spin this thing off and go build a business that just does this, because it's like every time that a client or prospective client sees it, it's like they all buy it.

We have one that's lingering because it's going through procurement or whatever, but I think that's probably the place. And I do, as I've told you before, believe that this whole idea of kind of services software is the way to go, at least from a curve-jumping standpoint.

it's the curve that we should be on. So I think some level of product development, solution accelerators, but just reusable IP in some way has to be, you know, part of the sort of blended equation, or if not, you're just going to get commoditized.

So I think that's the way I think about that.

[@1:03:28](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3808.87) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Can you tell me about a recent project where AI dramatically changed the delivery timeline in terms of what was possible now that wasn't before?

[@1:03:40](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=3820.51) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you about one, and it's like, again, it's also a double-edged sword, right? So we do, and this has been happening for a while.

So, like, as you know, we work with Stellantis, which is like, you know, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, you know, all of those brands.

And then every year they have this big game Super Bowl, they call it big game, but this big game kind of jump ball where a bunch of agencies pitch ideas for the Super Bowl.

And the client always wants to, because once they pick your idea, you've got to deal with all the business affairs stuff and get it shot and get it produced and get it approved by the network and all that stuff to make the Super Bowl.

And that happens now, and also it just happens, right, in October, because you've got to be ready for the Super Bowl.

We used to invest a lot of money, we've been doing it for years, where the client wants to see what they call a rip.

So it's basically an almost done TV spot that you didn't shoot, right, and you're using lots of like stock footage or any of that kind of stuff.

So they prefer a rip. That sometimes could cost us $30,000, $40,000 per idea to go pitch the idea that you may or may not.

So it's a very high level, like very high barrier of entry. And we're competing with Wyden Kennedy and these big agencies all the time to do this that have much bigger budgets and a lot more resources as it relates to that.

So sometimes we would do, like, so if we went in with five ideas, we went in with, you know, 10 ideas, we may do rips for one or two of them, right?

We may just have some, like, mood boards and ideas and scripts for some of them. And then sometimes we would do storyboards and pay somebody to do storyboards, right?

So I think a couple of years ago, we started doing storyboards with, like, Mitch. It was challenging but helpful because we could communicate concepts without all the expense, but you couldn't do a continuity of being able to do storyboards.

And as you know, that's changed. It takes a bunch of different tools, and you've got to pat a little spit and duct tape and string, and you kind of make it work to be able to do that.

You know, this year with, like, Sora and some other tools, like, we were able to produce a lot of really great rips to the point that the client's like, all right, this is ready to go.

And so there's a place where it's been really interesting, but what I will tell you, because we got some feedback, so we sold something in for Ram for the Daytona 500 and the launch of a new car, but we didn't get a Super Bowl spot this year.

You know, we had gotten one last year and then it fell through because of licensing, but we've been doing pretty well.

We didn't get one this year. And so I got some feedback from the client. And one of the things he told me is like, a lot of the agencies brought some really polished rips to the table, right?

And they, but they really refined the ideas and the scripts and that sort of thing. So we showed early concepts that looked like they were done.

And because they looked like they were done, they weren't good enough. If we would have showed the idea, they would have said, I love the idea.

And then you produce it and you start to work on it. So it was like, in a way, it was so, it was a lot more efficient.

It was a lot cheaper, you know. It was a lot faster, and we could afford to do more, but we didn't use the time that we saved to invest in the polish and craft of the concept and all that stuff, where others put the same level of effort with different tools, and the bar was just great.

And I've been talking to my team a lot about this, which basically says, okay, because the thing that used to take us 10 hours, we can do in 30 minutes, then you could just do the thing in 30 minutes and take the win and absorb the profits or whatever it is.

Go do something with something else, or you put in the 10 hours and you deliver something to the client that is...

You know, 10 times better than what you would have been able to do in that amount of time. And I think that if you do great work and you have great client relationships, the rest of the works itself out.

So I feel like AI, while it looks like you did a lot of work, sometimes people are mailing it in.

And, you know, they rewrite the first and last line of a copy, and then the rest of it came from, you know, like, I think that there's just, the shortcuts still show, right?

So it's like now our Spidey sense, when we see something, it's almost like you would see something and you would be impressed by all the work.

And now you see it and you're not impressed because you understand AI. You're like, yeah, well, that's par for the course, right?

It's just kind of like cars in the 30s would go a certain speed and cars today are like, would be faster than the fastest race.

But it's now an acceptable norm. So I think that's one of the things that's very interesting about our business in AI is that it doesn't just lower the level of effort.

It can really raise the level of product quality. But you've got to look at both sides of that equation or you're going to get beat by somebody that works you, right?

You still have to be nice to everybody and work harder than everybody else, and you'll be fine. So it's the fact that, you know, and that's part of the challenge, right?

So it's like suddenly if you introduce AI into your organization and it makes life easier for everybody and it reduces the level of effort from everybody, but then everybody just then fills that gap by doing less and going.

When a Pilates at 2 o'clock in the middle of , you know, Wednesday afternoon, all the time, because AI can do all their work, then maybe the individual, you know, sort of benefits from it, but the organization doesn't.

Yeah.

[@1:11:20](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4280.15) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

You kind of alluded to this in the bake-off. What is something that your competitors deliver with AI that you can't match yet, and how long before you close that gap?

[@1:11:39](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4299.65) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

See, I think about that.

[@1:11:44](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4304.53) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

I think about that differently, right?

[@1:11:46](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4306.93) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

And I know this is not what you want to hear. No, it's good. Feedback is great. I think about this slightly different, because I feel like...

And I've always said this. think technology is both a great differentiator until it is a great equalizer. Yeah.

[@1:12:15](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4335.47) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Right?

[@1:12:17](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4337.01) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

So I feel like if you're the first one, like I got on a Zoom this morning with my client.

At Discount Tire and Tire Rack. And I fired up Atlas and told Atlas to find me tires for this thing that were all-terrain and da-da-da.

And they saw it actually go out to Reddit and go out to all these blogs and go on their site and do the thing and a comparison.

And they were like, . We got to have a meeting. This is a thing, da-da-da, whatever. So here. An understanding of technology, right?

Because knowledge is power, right? So it's like an understanding or some kind of, in that case, it was just being aware that this was a thing, right?

And this launched six days ago, whatever. So being a first mover is like this really great opportunity until it's not.

Like now when everybody knows that, then the value of that knowledge or the value of that tool is democratized.

like everybody has it, right? So back to your question, I'm like, well, I'm a small shop. got three people working on the Super Bowl thing where BBDO's got 27 people and a business affairs department and a this and a that and all this stuff that like that.

I don't have, so I'm a, you know, I got a four-foot stick, they got an eight-foot stick, and I'm trying to fight them, right?

But then suddenly, technology or AI equals the playing field. So what really matters is the idea. What really matters is the quality of the script.

What really matters is the insight. You know, that's what really matters, not the other , right? So that's my perspective to it, right?

And that's why I was like, hey, guys, you got so caught up on the fact that you can do all these videos like they were done, but they're not great videos.

Like, the concept was flawed. The script was half-baked. And the client noticed that they're like, you guys really get this .

Like, you're setting the tone. The work that's out in the market is your work because you get it. And it's like, this stuff was good, but it wasn't great.

And we were impressed by the fact that you were able to create so many rips, and they looked so great.

But the concepts were, eh. You know, so there's where I think that the AI can be a huge, make a huge difference, but can also really level the playing field.

Yeah. what stands out is the human aspect is what rises above. Yeah.

[@1:15:34](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4534.55) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

And we're seeing all this stuff with AI work slop, where you're just getting these people are getting so fatigued because they're getting, you know, 20 page responses from Claude or GPT.

And to your point, they might tweak the beginning, tweak the end, but they don't make that effort to say, what is the essence here?

What am I putting into it? I got a really good, maybe it's better than a first draft, but... What am I doing to really elevate this?

How am I using it to critique my work and make my work better, as opposed to offload my cognitive capability to AI?

[@1:16:10](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4570.39) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

This is about social learning and organizational change. So I'm going to talk to you about data culture and decision velocity.

Can you tell me about a strategic decision that AI influenced and how long it took from question to decision?

[@1:16:46](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4606.85) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

A decision that was...

[@1:16:59](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4619.21) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

... Personally? I'll give you a good one. I need to take my blood pressure medicine. I'll tell you this story that's going to blow your mind.

So, did I tell you that we got caught up in the Rite Aid bankruptcy? Rite Aid was a client.

No. So, Rite Aid was a client of ours. We had a pretty, you know, like a $60,000, $70,000. Like, we had a big retainer.

We worked with them for two and a half years, right? And we were basically restructuring their loyalty program. We were managing their loyalty program.

So, long story, you know, to save money, they had, you know, one of the big shops come in and redesign their loyalty program on the other side of that.

Their customers were revolting, right? So we had to go in and fix it without moving it back to the way it was because economically it wasn't viable.

So we're working with these guys. You know, things are going really well. They had some big challenges as a company.

We knew that they were in trouble, but they hired us to help kind of fix things. Long story short, we're two and a half years into this thing.

And we get a call. They want to cancel our contract. You know, we had a 60-day out or 30-day out.

They wanted to give us notice. They're canceling the contract, et cetera. And then we learned that they filed for bankruptcy, like, in the news, not from them.

You know, all of that kind of stuff. So it was gone. They, so we, you know, filed our things or whatever it is, and they affect them.

didn't pay us about $230,000. So we had $230,000 of invoices that were never paid. You know, they sat on our books for a while.

We tried to whatever, and they're like, it's bankruptcy. You're . Everybody's . You're gone. And we wrote it off in January.

We wrote off $230,000. Not fun, right? So that was this time last year, guess, this time last year. So on Thursday, on Thursday, I get an email from the law firm that handled the bankruptcy for Rite Aid, saying that they are enacting this clawback law that's called preferential payments or something like that.

Yeah. Yeah. And that basically we received the 90 days prior to them filing for bankruptcy, that we had received payments in the amount of $184,000.

And there is a law that says we need to give that money back. And then they will redistribute it to all of the creditors in an equitable manner.

In other words, we're going to claw back. So we you. $230,000, you're out of pocket for work that you did.

And now we're going to claw back our last payment to you and distribute it evenly amongst all the other people we owe money to.

Correct. And I'm like, this is a scam. You know, now you're filthy. You're like, this is . Like, I'm like, whatever.

This is . So I uploaded the summons and all that stuff in the chat GPT. I started asking questions to understand all this .

They wanted me to receive. Spawned with, you know, send me this stuff saying that you didn't, you know, whatever it is.

And I spent, you know, 30 minutes going back and forth, you know, training this thing, giving it context, doing whatever it is.

And it basically told me, you know, what the situation was. Specifically, it's filed in New Jersey. This is what ends up happening.

I had gotten two solicitations from law firms that were trying to put together class action, like group defenses for people that had gotten these things and whatever, you know, all of this stuff.

I put everything in there. I got as smart as I could, you know, obviously called our council, et cetera.

And it basically told me, don't sign those things. Do this. This is what you need to do. You know, and I ended up, you know, calling my lawyer.

You're like asking for a very specific thing from the lawyer, getting someone that had a specific kind of experience.

Yeah. And, you know, it sort of put me in a good path, the decisions of who I was going to hire, what I was going to do, all of that kind of stuff.

I think without these tools, you know, I, like, I would have had a heart attack. I'm still . It's still, like, it's the most unfair thing that you can imagine.

And, you know, and ChatGPT tells you, you can do all these things, but you're going to pay something. Like, you're not going to get out of it.

So it's sort of set expectations, too. So very, so.

[@1:22:38](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4958.87) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

So incredibly helpful, enabling you to sift through something that was ridiculously uncomfortable, that needed to be responded to quickly, and it helped you navigate it better with, even though it's not an ideal outcome, it's a better outcome than, you know, So.

It could have been, and it's also helping you pick who and how.

[@1:23:03](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=4983.93) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

You know what I'm dealing with, and frankly, not getting taken advantage of beyond, because what would have happened is it would have been even, right?

It's like, I still would have to pay the money. I'm barely going to get, you know, like my recourse is whim or none.

And then I have people that are, you know, wanting $800 an hour to go represent me on something that's.

So it was very helpful. Like, and again, I think it was like, and I didn't even, I didn't even think twice about it.

It wasn't like, oh, I should do this. It was just like immediately, you know, like you're just, that's how, that's how you do now.

[@1:23:45](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5025.63) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

This is more of you on who has access to what. Who in the organization has access to AI-powered insight, would you say, for decision making?

Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. 사람. Bye.

[@1:24:01](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5041.75) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Everyone. Okay.

[@1:24:04](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5044.83) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

So there's no barriers to what's available to any one particular person in terms of using data to make AI-informed decisions?

[@1:24:16](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5056.85) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Well, I mean, there's certain data that people can't look at payroll. Right. You know, people can't, you know, not any of that stuff.

So, you know, as long as they have access to the data, they have, you know, ability to reason with it.

Yeah.

[@1:24:39](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5079.21) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

I think a better version of this question for the future would be, you know, are there any barriers to data access for AI-driven decision making?

Who has access and who doesn't?

[@1:24:51](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5091.39) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I think that's probably a better question. Yeah. Um.

[@1:24:56](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5096.53) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

. . . . What would you need to change in the organization for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced?

[@1:25:24](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5124.61) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Again, I think that the answer is tied to those individual tracks that I kind of made up before. It wasn't quite structured, but I do feel like, you know, if I could do it, in other words, if I could afford to do it, I would probably bring in someone.

This is interesting because it's not solely about AI. It's AI as a multiplier to something else. So, like, for example, AI.

I would love to hire someone to do, like, agency operations and identify, you know, places where processes and tools and all that stuff would make a lot of sense, and that person to be wired to leverage AI in both the design, implementation, and operation of those systems, right?

So I feel like if I had a magic wand and I could find that person that would do that, I think it would make all the difference in the world.

But I think that person would have to have experience in business context beyond AI to be successful.

[@1:26:55](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5215.03) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

I want to talk about collaboration. How has AI changed how your team... And can you give me any specific examples of new collaboration patterns?

[@1:27:16](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5236.67) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I think in some ways it's made it worse. I think in some ways it's made it worse. Because I think there's a lot of tool fragmentation, right, and sort of cross-platform compatibility stuff.

I think that – and this is not necessarily a bad thing. I think this may be a good thing.

I think one of the sort of post-COVID hangovers is that you spend such a big part of your life sitting on Zoom like we are right now and not head down working, right?

Right. And so you're trying to address that culturally, right? It's like to actually create room to do the work, right?

And then now you're providing people with this really amazing partner to work with, right? So the collaboration is a human-AI collaboration versus a human-to-human collaboration.

So you're seeing more of that. But there's only a finite amount of time, so it's at the expense of the human connection.

So I think you have to solve the meeting and task assignments. And if a lot of what you accomplish through email and meetings and video calls and all of that stuff can be structured and automated, and your time is spent...

have you so you have a lot time, time, you do time, you time And actually, like, what have you put out into the world today, as opposed to moving emails around and documents around?

Like, I think that that is one of the challenges that we have, organizationally and culturally, is, like, how do you address that?

And even, like, Maddie the other day, you know, was encouraging me to use voice for prompting. And I've done it.

And it's a lot better. But by design, it means that I've to close my door. I've got to go somewhere where there aren't any people because I get self-conscious.

It's like if everybody was – it's the reason VR headsets don't work, right? If, you know, if you're a hermit and you don't date and you're just, like, living in your parents' basement and have no social life, those things are amazing.

But, like, try to put one, you know, put one on in the couch when your wife is sitting there.

You just – Literally shut her out of your world, right? And it feels wrong, and it's rude, and whatever.

Now, it may be crazy, you know, so now you've to, like, you've got to find a time where, and it feels selfish.

I'm not with my kid. I'm not with my wife. I'm not with my colleagues. I'm going to sit in this corner and have this very sort of personal experience.

And I think the whole, you know, like, her thing of, like, now I'm going to, everybody who's talking about, like, voice on your phone is going to be, you know, when it's an AI assistant and you're just having your chats with your phone, that sounds really great.

Until you're in public or in any social setting or whatever it is, and then you're just, like, one of those freaks that talks to their phone without putting it to their ear.

Like, those people, you know? Like, it's just rude. So I just think that that's a, I think that's a, I think that's a challenge, right?

So I actually think that that's a, that's a challenge. is we're trying to create more communal environments and more people in the place collaborating and all of this stuff.

But then you have this, like, so humans are not multi-threaded, right? So it's like you're either, that's why attention is so scarce, right?

It's like if I'm listening to my radio station in my brain and I'm talking to you, this is not a productive conversation, right?

But then now I have this other channel, which is my relationship with the agent or with my, you know, AI companion.

How does that work? How do you navigate that thing, you know? So that's why I love these note takers because, like, there's a point where it's like, okay, I can worry about having a conversation with you, and now I have all this stuff and whatever it is.

I actually feel that that's really freeing, but you have to have the discipline to then go back to your notes and do something with it.

I like the motion one versus Fathom because when it creates all of the follow-ups, all the tasks and the do, I mean, this is like a feature somebody fixes it, but basically I can create tasks directly from it.

So it'll create tasks directly that are in my workflow and reminders and all that . So it makes me follow through with my commitments or go back to things that I wanted to go back to, which I think is really helpful.

But I think you have to think about this culturally, how does this work in the way that it – and I do think right now I'm seeing a lot less collaboration in some cases.

You know, like, but it's different, though. It's different because, like, let's say on the deck stuff that I was talking about, like, before, you see, you know, people using, like, Google Slides and leaving comments and doing whatever, and they would work on something.

It wasn't very efficient, but they're doing that. So now they're in AI tools that have that, right? But the other people aren't used to using those things, so they're not really collaborating.

It has it. It's just they're not really collaborating on it. But they're pulling in templates and they're pulling in assets that other people created and were added to the library.

So they're collaborating, but it's a different kind of collaboration. It's not sort of real time. And frankly, I think, like, psychologically, there's different values to different kinds of collaboration, right?

Like, that you... You have to sort of think about, like, I always tell a story about executives being in a room in front of a whiteboard and putting together a mission statement, which is like this big compromise that means nothing.

Because it was, first of all, some of us are not really great in the room in front of a whiteboard in front of a bunch of people, and you're more of an introvert, and you're actually going back into your office or in the shower going to have better ideas.

Other people are really great in those environments.

[@1:34:30](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5670.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

So, like, how do you know what the right situation is? So, I don't know. I think that's an open switch right now.

I think it's an open switch. Yeah. I don't know.

[@1:34:52](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5692.29) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

No, it's a really good answer, and it gets into into, um, it gets areas where Where it makes it harder, and obviously we touched on some of the areas where it's, I mean, the note-takers are great, but yeah, there's a lot of areas where it's not necessarily there yet in terms of what we want it to be.

Last section, and then three quick closeout questions. So the last section is the evolve stage. This is about strategic vision and thought leadership.

So in terms of competitors, which we've talked about a bit, can you name your three most AI advanced competitors, whether you want to pick agencies or consultancies or hybrids?

[@1:35:45](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5745.07) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, that's a really good question. I think who I look to is the Brandtech group. I don't know if you know who they are.

[@1:35:57](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5757.23) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

But- No.

[@1:35:59](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=5759.71) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

No. That's a whole other interesting kind of strategic conversation. But so there are a bunch of – let me go to their site real quick because it's really their brand.

So – Where am I? Come on. Come on. Have you ever heard of Pencil? Mm-mm. Okay, so Brand Tech Group, let me tell you about these people.

It's , like you'll find this interesting, right? So I'm trying to remember the name of this thing. So there was an agency that was started about the same time that I started Glue.

Maybe a year earlier in the UK, and it was like one of those stupid British agency names, like, you know, Blue Pants Without a Hat.

Like some , I just made that, but like some ridiculous, like name of a creative agency. And they eventually changed their name, like they changed the name to the Brand Tech Group.

I'm like, how do you get from that to that, right? And... So what I found out is there was a holding company, basically like a private equity group, that was investing mostly in MarTech and AdTech, right?

So they were buying a lot of these tools, like Gen.AI-type tools, early stage and all this . So there's a platform called Pencil that was like the big thing.

So think about like Notion for Project Man, whatever. But Pencil was like the platform that got the most traction.

You know, they would have a yacht at Cannes, right? Like they were very going after the agencies and all this .

And it was the promise of it is a generative AI tool for agencies to start in a whole operating system.

does everything for you. You know, it connects to all your stuff. This is a new AI tool. operating systems.

This was a few years ago, right? And every time that they would show something with these models, everybody was like, oh, whatever.

So this company, right, this holding company that owned all these tech tools, it was kind of like at Sapient when we started buying traditional agencies, right?

Is what they did is they bought an agency, right? They bought an agency called Oliver. I don't know if you ever heard about Oliver.

Oliver is this other UK agency, fastest growing agency in the last five years. And their go-to-market strategy is, are you ready to insource?

Where a consultancy that comes in and will show you will help you build an internal team. Stop using agencies.

time that you bring inside. Big trend. That was singular go-to-market value proposition. operating systems. This was a few years ago, right?

And every time that they would show something with these models, everybody was like, oh, whatever. So this company, right, this holding company that owned all these tech tools, it was kind of like at Sapient when we started buying traditional agencies, right?

Is what they did is they bought an agency, right? They bought an agency called Oliver. I don't know if you ever heard about Oliver.

Oliver is this other UK agency, fastest growing agency in the last five years. And their go-to-market strategy is, are you ready to insource?

Where a consultancy that comes in and will show you will help you build an internal team. Stop using agencies.

time that you bring inside. Big trend. That was singular go-to-market value proposition. They started at the same time that we did.

They became the fastest-growing agency in the world, right? And they're in everything because they were the unagency agency. They're like, these people are wasting your money.

We're going to help you do it. One of our guys, I don't know if you remember him. God, was his name?

They'll come to me in a second. The guy that worked with us, I kind of feel like he was in New York, too.

No, no, he was in Miami. I went to work there. I run into him at an airport one day, and he tells me that he's working at this place.

And I'm like, yeah, I know who they are. You know what's going on. And he basically fills me in on what the racket is, right?

So he's like, look, we would go in, and we would say, hey, you're working with publicists, and you're paying them $5 million a year.

I'm like, yeah. You let the agency grade their own homework. You don't have agency control over your , the engine that drives your business.

It doesn't make sense. You would save 40%. This is a sales pitch. You would save 40% if you build this in-house.

We know people, process tools, et cetera. We'll come in and do that. We'll hire the people. We'll do all this stuff.

And once it's all up and running, we'll put those people to work for you. That's all they sell, right?

, they're just shooting fish in a barrel doing all this stuff. And he tells me, he's like, gee, he's like, 70% of the time, at some point, the client's like, you guys are doing a good job.

Why do need to hire all these people? Just keep doing it. So he's like, we end up getting agency of record, multiple-year relationships, right, that are, there was no pitch.

It's non-competitive, you know, it's whatever. It's a great thing. So this company, so 70% of the time, so they're selling an AOR deal without selling an AOR deal, right?

That's like a girl moving in. You know, that's a big Trojan horse. So that's their whole thing. So they get bought by this brand tech group, which is a technology group.

That owns this platform called Pencil. That all of the holding companies, Fulbis is a client, Havas is a client, like all these people or whatever.

So effectively, they get bought by a technology company. A technology company buys an agency. And what this guy tells me is like, this is what's going on.

It's like, so we go in and we put in, we hire the people. We put in the processes. We

We tell them what their tool set is, but they're like, now, if we actually leave, the tools that they're using are owned by our parent company, which is Pencil, right?

So they get recurring SaaS revenue forever, right? It's genius. So then they went and they bought a performance marketing agency called Jellyfish, and they gave them tools.

But what's interesting, so Jellyfish has proprietary AI tools for performance marketing, generative AI tools. Oliver has an agency operating system that's all AI-driven.

Now, all of the Jellyfish tool is Pencil. The, the, they just...

[@1:45:00](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6300.69) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

The Oliver Tool is Pencil.

[@1:45:04](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6304.07) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

They have a Collectively, which is like a social media agency. So they're buying, they're almost creating a holding company that is all AI powered.

But the tech investment across all those agencies is centralized and they also sell it. So remember I was telling you that we had all these sales.

The earlier question that you asked, and it was, you know, I talked to my brother who's at Interpublic now and whatever, and he's like, dude, you got to get Pencil.

That's what everybody uses. like, that's the stigma of this , you know, that everybody, whatever. So I call the Pencil people, they won't call you back.

So, so they, they have some exclusive deals with holding companies. They will not sell. They no longer sell access to Pencil to small independent agencies.

Oh my God. Wow. Right?

[@1:46:04](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6364.55) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

So that's my very, very long answer to your very short and direct question is that I feel like there's a big gap in the market, right?

I think there's a handful of them that are basically AI companies masquerading as agencies, and those are the ones that are really far ahead, right?

[@1:46:26](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6386.69) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

And then I think everybody else is struggling, and they're doing the same thing. They're looking for love in all the wrong places, buying every tool, trying everything, and it changes every other week.

There's a lot of just kind of AI fragmentation and chaos, and it's a bit of a mess. And we've been talking about how do we curate a stack, and that's the stuff that I'm talking to Matty about.

But it – so I look at those brand tech group, and I'm like, dude, got to – you know, you got to give due or due – like credit or due or due or whatever.

That, I think, is a brilliant strategy. I wish I would have thought about it, and I'm not ashamed to copy it.

So with the same level of candor, if we surveyed your clients about whether you are an AI leader or laggard compared to other agencies and consultancies, what would your clients say?

I think it's patchy. I think you're going to get a big spectrum. And so I think that all of our advisory clients are going to tell you that we are the best of the best because that's why they're hiring us.

And then I think some of our longstanding clients are going to be like, hey, I haven't seen a lot of that.

Some of them have, though, like RBC and stuff like that. We keep doing all these AI-only videos that they used to spend a lot of money on, and now they're getting better, bigger things for a lot less money, and they're, like, showing it around.

But they're kind of JV.

[@1:48:03](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6483.19) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

And then I think that some of the traditional – no, you know something? I think we'd get good grades across the board.

Like I'm trying to think of where somebody would be like, yeah, no, they're not thinking about that.

[@1:48:19](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6499.75) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I don't think so. I was going to tell you like Evermore, which is that resort and that very traditional kind of thing.

I would be like, yeah, we don't really do anything that's that. But I'm like – then I just thought about it and it's like we launched the resort before it was built.

And all of the that went to market was all AI. And that was four years ago, right? So that was like really early days.

So I think we'd get good marks. But think – but to your earlier point, we get more credit than

And so from client perception, where do you think people feel that you're leading in AI?

[@1:49:10](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6550.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Where would you, just to anchor it even further, make it a little more specific, what would they say?

[@1:49:22](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6562.45) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I would say creative production analytics and strategy. I mean, it's the whole thing, but it's creative production analytics and strategy.

And again, I think, you know, on the strategy side, we're probably a 7 out of 10\. On the generative AI, we're probably a 5 out of 10\.

And on the analytics, 4 out of 10, and we get credit for 11 out of 10, like I think.

That's a place where it's like we've got to catch up to our reputation for the most part. Two final questions in this section and then a quick wrap-up.

What AI development in the next 18 months could fundamentally disrupt your business model, and how are you preparing for that?

I think a genetic search is going to be the biggest or is the biggest disruption. I just... I think it's agentic, but I can explain what I mean by it, right?

If you were to take 100 clients, marketers, right, 100 marketers, both B2B and B2C, and you looked at their entire media mix or acquisition or sales channels or whatever it is, the top two places where they spend money and they get the best return on spend is paid search and email, the own media and demand harvesting, right?

So, like, Discount Tire spends $90 million on paid search. Crazy. Just think about that, right? So those are the two big things.

Those two things, and that's why... That's why I'm so freaking out by that Atlas Browser thing. And it doesn't matter what size.

So those are the two most important things, right? And in a lot of cases, it's what makes the numbers work, right?

So we spend $100 million in media across the whole funnel, right? And our return on ad spend is X.

Well, there's a bunch of at $2. There's a bunch of stuff at one or two X. And there's one thing at $14 or $12, right?

But when you report on it, you blend it, right? So suddenly, the efficiency of your search channel goes down by 30% overnight, which has happened in a lot of cases, by the way.

With Agentex Search already, right? How do you make that up? And if your CFO looks at it and says, hey, you used to get 12x return on ad spend, and now you're at 1x.

Should we put that money somewhere else? Because that doesn't give us a good return. like, it could really things up.

So it's, like, it's going to create a bunch of opportunity on the consulting and modernization side. Yeah. Right? But it's also going to change things in a big way.

So, like, just a simple tool that you use personally, right? It's, I don't know. I don't know if you're a, I don't know.

why. I I don't know. with Bombas, like socks, right? I buy Bombas. I don't know if you like, whatever.

I have this , you know, some that you found on Instagram that you learn and you like, and now I order it all the time.

Well, they send me emails with offers and , and every once in a while, I actually take them up on.

I buy the same T-shirt at the same place in L.A. for whatever it is, and I get those emails.

I've filtered all that out now, right? Because now the browser has some magenta capabilities. reading all your stuff, and there's a lot less making it to your primary inbox, right?

Imagine on the other side of that, that is the most profitable, the best return, and the lowest cost thing that all those companies are doing that cannot afford to do TV, that cannot afford to buy ads, that cannot, you know, whatever it is.

So the most efficient thing, right, is go. Or at cut in half, or cut by two-thirds, because now we're marketing to ages, right?

[@1:55:08](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6908.57) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

So you look at that problem, and you've got to sweat it all day long, because there's going to be winners and losers that come out of that change, right?

And you want to be on the winning side of it, right? And so it's like back in the day when we used to be like, it's all going digital, it's all going digital, and the direct mail lady's like, direct mail makes all the money, and it works for us, and we have a system, and it's like that email , like that's not whatever, and then at some point, they're extinct, right?

[@1:55:43](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=6943.95) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

But it's like, I think paid search and email are two things that people are maybe not freaking out about as much as they should be.

So that to me is the biggest, single biggest, like, in the... In the very near term kind of situation.

There's other things down there. mean, I think about all the other stuff that's coming, but I think that's the biggest one.

Last question is a human one. As AI handles more analytical and routine work, what uniquely human value does GlueIQ bring that becomes more important?

And how are you doubling down on that? The most important is human value. So also a tricky question to answer, because I think...

I think there are some things that matter now that are going to matter less over time. So this has a slower degradation curve, right?

So I do think design sense and taste is something that's kind of like what we were talking about, those notion documents, right?

Is that there's still this, look, we all as humans have this kind of spidey sense, right? You can walk into a store, you can be in a mall in Spain, you know, and walk into a store that you never heard of.

You don't know the brand, you don't know what it is. Take two steps and you look around and you're like, this is high end, this is low end, this is a big company, this is a small company.

[@1:57:58](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=7078.07) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

They care about their customers.

[@1:57:59](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=7079.75) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

They Don't care about the customer. This is high quality or whatever. You can, if you don't speak a lick of Spanish, you can read a lick of Spanish, can't read the sign or any of that stuff, you could figure that out immediately, right?

AI doesn't have that sensibility yet. You still have to give it direction. You could tell it to show you what to remodel your apartment, but it doesn't know that mid-century modern may be a really great solution, right?

So I think that taste and design sense, curation and all of that stuff is, but I don't believe that that will be such a big deal three years from now.

So I think that that's one of those things where it's...

[@1:59:00](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=7140.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

It'll start to go the other way, right? I do think that sort of breaking through the clutter, just creativity from that perspective, know, like trying to come up with new ideas, it still needs to be directed by, you know, a human.

I got one there, here. I think those are the big things. I don't know.

[@1:59:44](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=7184.45) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

I don't know. That's great. So this went longer than it's supposed to go, but this was our first run.

It's because I tell a 30-minute story for every question you ask. Hopefully other people won't be the same. No, I, uh.

So the final three wrap-ups, I think one of these is overlong, which would be thinking about everything we discussed, what's your honest assessment of your organization's AI and adaptability transformation?

I think that's a throwaway. I think we've addressed that holistically. I think asking somebody to sum that up is sort of silly.

The two questions that I think are decent, and we don't have to do these together, but I think these are kind of decent as wrap-ups, which is, what's one thing that if we don't address in the next 90 days could derail your AI transformation?

And then what surprised you most about our conversation today? What are you thinking about differently?

[@2:00:48](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=7248.23) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

I think on the derailment, it goes back to the adopting modern ways of working and changing and changing and changing and changing

And getting that sort of PM account management layer to really be open to changing the way that they work.

I think that's the biggest one. What was most surprising? I feel like I want to take this recording and notes and help shape kind of a North Star statement for our team to understand and drive alignment around the sets of things that I just said.

Because I don't think I've done that well. That was my big point.

[@2:01:46](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=7306.67) \- **Gaston Legorburu (GlueIQ)**

And that's the thrust of this, right?

[@2:01:49](https://fathom.video/share/KVf1DzTzYUyiKqrk9yzYxxM3LFatFyca?timestamp=7309.71) \- **Alex Schwartz (GlueIQ)**

Like that's what the one of the key things that this needs to deliver when we roll it out is that you go across the LT, you go across the C-suite.

You get all the answers, you put them all together, you see where there's alignment, you see where there's gaps, you see where there's opportunities in the leadership team, and then you see across the employee base, you know, where they're at, and then how do you kind of reimagine and re-articulate the vision, the strategy, and the go-forward plan so that everybody's on the same page and that it just moves a lot more smoothly.

Did you like it overall? You feel like it was good? Yeah, no, this was really great, great exercise. Okay.

I do have to go. Go, go. I'm going to, I will do a minor tweak of this based upon kind of what I thought landed the most with you, and I will jump to getting time with Maggie and Kujawa next, and I'll go through with them.

Awesome. All right, brother. right, sir. You too. Bye.
