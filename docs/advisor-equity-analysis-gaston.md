# Advisor Equity Analysis: Gaston Legorburu Proposal

## Executive Summary

The proposed 0.75% base + 0.25% performance kicker (1.0% total potential) is **at the high end of standard advisor ranges** but justifiable given Gaston's multi-faceted contribution (strategic guidance + pilot partnership + active deal sourcing). However, several structural details need clarification before finalizing.

## Industry Benchmarks for Advisor Equity

| Advisor Type | Typical Equity Range | Vesting |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Standard Advisor** (monthly calls, occasional input) | 0.25% - 0.50% | 2 years, monthly or quarterly |
| **Strategic Advisor** (weekly engagement, domain expertise) | 0.50% - 1.0% | 2 years, often with cliff |
| **Advisor + Active BD** (sourcing deals, making intros) | 0.75% - 1.5% | 2 years + performance components |
| **Board Advisor / Chair** | 1.0% - 2.0% | 2-4 years |
| **Technical Advisor** (hands-on product/engineering) | 0.50% - 1.0% | 2 years |

### Where Gaston Fits

Gaston is functioning as a **Strategic Advisor + Active BD**, which places him in the 0.75% - 1.5% range. Your proposal of 0.75% base + 0.25% kicker = **1.0% total potential** is:

- ✅ Within market range
- ✅ Appropriately structured (base + performance)
- ⚠️ Slightly aggressive for a pre-revenue/early-stage company if equity is scarce

## Detailed Equity Structure Analysis

### Component 1: Base Advisory Equity (0.75%)

| Aspect | Your Proposal | Assessment |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Amount** | 0.75% | Appropriate for weekly engagement + pilot partnership |
| **Vesting Period** | 2 years | Standard |
| **Cliff** | 1 year | Standard |
| **Backdating** | To June 2025 | Good faith gesture; ~6 months credit toward cliff |

**What 0.75% Means at Different Valuations:**

| Company Valuation | 0.75% Value | 1.0% Value (with kicker) |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| $1M | $7,500 | $10,000 |
| $5M | $37,500 | $50,000 |
| $10M | $75,000 | $100,000 |
| $25M | $187,500 | $250,000 |
| $50M | $375,000 | $500,000 |

**Recommendation:** Include current valuation context or 409A valuation (if available) so Gaston understands the tangible value.

---

### Component 2: Deal Flow Compensation

You've proposed two options:

#### Option A: Equity Kicker
- **Amount:** Additional 0.25%
- **Trigger:** When referral revenue reaches $200K

#### Option B: Revenue Share
- **Amount:** 5% of first-year revenue on closed deals
- **Trigger:** Per deal closed

### Comparative Analysis

| Scenario | Option A (Equity Kicker) | Option B (Revenue Share) |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **1 deal @ $50K** | Nothing (below threshold) | $2,500 cash |
| **2 deals @ $100K each** | 0.25% equity unlocked | $10,000 cash |
| **4 deals @ $100K each** | 0.25% equity unlocked | $20,000 cash |
| **1 large deal @ $200K** | 0.25% equity unlocked | $10,000 cash |

**Key Insight:** The revenue share is more attractive for smaller deal volumes, while the equity kicker rewards hitting a meaningful threshold but offers nothing below it.

### Issues to Clarify

1. **$200K threshold** — Is this:
   - Cumulative across all referrals? (more achievable)
   - A single deal threshold? (much harder)
   - Annual or lifetime?

2. **5% of first-year revenue** — Does this include:
   - Implementation/setup fees?
   - Recurring subscription revenue?
   - Upsells within Year 1?
   - What about multi-year contracts paid upfront?

3. **Attribution window** — How long after an introduction is a deal considered "sourced" by Gaston?
   - 6 months? 12 months? Lifetime?

4. **Can he earn both?** — Or is it explicitly either/or?

## Vesting Structure Deep Dive

### Current Proposal
- 2-year vesting
- 1-year cliff
- Backdated to June 2025

### What This Means Practically

```
Timeline (assuming formalized December 2025):

June 2025      - Vesting "starts" (backdated)
December 2025  - Agreement signed (6 months credited)
June 2026      - Cliff reached, 50% vested (0.375%)
June 2027      - Fully vested (0.75%)
```

### Missing Vesting Details

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Monthly or quarterly vesting after cliff?** | Monthly is advisor-friendly; quarterly is simpler |
| **What happens if Gaston stops advising?** | Vesting stops, but does he keep vested shares? (usually yes) |
| **Acceleration on acquisition?** | Single trigger (accelerates on sale) or double trigger (sale + termination)? |
| **What if Human Glue raises funding?** | Does his % get diluted? (yes, unless anti-dilution clause) |
| **Exercise window if options?** | 90 days post-termination is standard; some companies offer 10 years |

### Recommendation: Single-Trigger Acceleration

For advisors, single-trigger acceleration (100% vests on acquisition) is common and expected. This protects Gaston if Human Glue is acquired before his vesting completes.

## Equity Type Considerations

You haven't specified what form the equity takes:

| Type | Pros | Cons | Tax Implications |
|------|------|------|------------------|
| **Common Stock Grant** | Simple, immediate ownership | Taxable at grant as income | Can be significant if valued high |
| **Stock Options (NSO)** | No tax until exercise | Requires cash to exercise | Taxed as ordinary income on spread |
| **Restricted Stock** | Real ownership, voting rights | 83(b) election complexity | Can defer taxes with 83(b) |
| **Advisor Shares (common)** | Industry standard | Same as common stock | Taxable at FMV when granted |

**Recommendation:** Most startups use **Restricted Stock Awards** or **Stock Options** for advisors. If using options, specify:
- Strike price (usually current FMV / 409A valuation)
- Exercise window (90 days to 10 years post-termination)
- Option type (NSO for advisors, not ISO)

---

## Risk Assessment for Human Glue

### Giving Away Too Much?

| Consideration | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| **Total advisor pool** | Startups typically reserve 1-5% for all advisors. If you have or plan to have multiple advisors, 1% to one person is significant. |
| **Stage of company** | Early stage = equity is cheap but precious. Are you confident Gaston will deliver $200K+ in deal flow? |
| **Alternative cost** | What would you pay a BD consultant or fractional sales leader? $5K-15K/month? Equity may be cheaper. |
| **Relationship value** | GlueIQ as a pilot + his credibility may be worth more than the deal flow |

### Recommendation

The equity amount is defensible IF:
1. You have a defined advisor pool and this fits within it
2. Gaston's network is genuinely likely to produce deals
3. The GlueIQ pilot partnership has tangible value beyond advisory

---

## Alternative Structures to Consider

### Option 1: Lower Base, Higher Performance
```
Base:        0.50% (2-year vest, 1-year cliff)
Deal Flow:   0.50% unlocked at $200K cumulative revenue
             OR 7% of first-year revenue per deal
```
**Rationale:** More upside tied to measurable outcomes

### Option 2: Tiered Performance Unlocks
```
Base:        0.50%
Tier 1:      +0.15% at $100K cumulative referral revenue
Tier 2:      +0.20% at $250K cumulative referral revenue
Tier 3:      +0.15% at $500K cumulative referral revenue
Total:       1.0% maximum
```
**Rationale:** Creates ongoing incentive rather than one-time unlock

### Option 3: Hybrid Cash + Equity
```
Base:        0.50%
Deal Flow:   3% cash commission on closed deals
             +0.25% equity at $300K cumulative
```
**Rationale:** Immediate cash reward for deals, equity for sustained performance

## Questions to Answer Before Finalizing

### For Internal Decision-Making

1. What is your current 409A valuation (or best estimate)?
2. How much equity have you reserved for advisors total?
3. How many other advisors do you plan to bring on?
4. What's your realistic expectation for deal flow from Gaston in Year 1?
5. Is the GlueIQ pilot partnership genuinely valuable, or more symbolic?

### To Clarify in the Agreement

1. Equity type (options, restricted stock, common shares)
2. Vesting schedule specifics (monthly vs quarterly after cliff)
3. Acceleration provisions (single trigger recommended)
4. Deal attribution window and definition
5. Whether deal flow equity and revenue share are mutually exclusive
6. $200K threshold definition (cumulative vs single deal, timeframe)
7. What counts as "first-year revenue" for commission calculation
8. Exercise window if using options

---

## Recommended Final Structure

Based on the analysis, here's a refined proposal:

```
ADVISORY EQUITY
---------------
Base Grant:     0.75% (Advisor Shares or Restricted Stock)
Vesting:        2 years, monthly after 1-year cliff
Backdated to:   June 1, 2025
Acceleration:   100% single-trigger on acquisition

DEAL FLOW COMPENSATION
----------------------
Primary:        5% of first-year contract value on closed referral deals
                (includes implementation + Year 1 recurring revenue)

Bonus:          Additional 0.25% equity unlocked when cumulative
                referral revenue reaches $250K (increased from $200K
                to make total package cleaner)

Attribution:    Deals closed within 12 months of introduction qualify

TOTAL POTENTIAL: 1.0% equity + uncapped deal commissions
```

## Summary

| Aspect | Your Proposal | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Base equity** | 0.75% | ✅ Keep as-is |
| **Vesting** | 2yr / 1yr cliff | ✅ Add monthly vesting after cliff |
| **Backdating** | June 2025 | ✅ Good faith gesture |
| **Deal kicker** | 0.25% at $200K | ⚠️ Clarify cumulative vs single deal |
| **Revenue share** | 5% of Year 1 | ⚠️ Define what's included |
| **Either/or choice** | Yes | ⚠️ Consider making it additive or pick one |
| **Acceleration** | Not specified | ❌ Add single-trigger |
| **Equity type** | Not specified | ❌ Must specify |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Internal:** Decide on equity type and confirm cap table allocation
2. **Internal:** Pick preferred deal flow structure (don't make him choose)
3. **With Gaston:** Discuss on next call, gauge reaction to structure
4. **Legal:** Have advisor agreement drafted with all specifics
5. **Final:** Execute agreement, issue equity grant
