## ROI Calculation Methodologies

### 1. Simple ROI Calculation
```
ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment × 100
```

**Example**: 
- Investment: $200,000 in AI tools and training
- Savings: $150,000 in efficiency gains
- Learning improvements: $200,000 value
- ROI = ($350,000 - $200,000) / $200,000 × 100 = 75%

### 2. Total Value of Ownership (TVO)
```
TVO = Direct Benefits + Indirect Benefits + Strategic Value - Total Costs
```

**Components**:
- Direct: Measurable financial returns
- Indirect: Productivity, satisfaction, reputation
- Strategic: Future options, capabilities
- Costs: Initial + ongoing + opportunity costs

### 3. Social Return on Investment (SROI)
```
SROI = Social Value Created / Investment × Impact Multiplier
```

**Factors**:
- Student lifetime earnings increase
- Community economic development
- Reduced social services needs
- Intergenerational effects

### 4. Balanced Scorecard Approach
**Four Perspectives**:
1. Financial: Traditional ROI metrics
2. Student/Parent: Satisfaction and outcomes
3. Internal Process: Efficiency and quality
4. Learning & Growth: Innovation and capability
