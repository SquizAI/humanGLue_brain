## BOTTOM LINE (HEALTHCARE VERTICAL)

The healthcare AI transformation market is:
- **Massive:** Every hospital, health system, and practice needs this
- **Urgent:** CMS quality programs and value-based care demand AI adoption
- **Underserved:** No program addresses clinical + regulatory + cultural holistically
- **High-value:** Executives will pay premium ($8,500) for healthcare-specific expertise

**UCF STLI can own the healthcare AI leadership education market in the Southeast.**

With AdventHealth, Orlando Health, and Lake Nona partnerships, we have immediate credibility and pilot opportunities.

**This is a $3M+ standalone revenue stream from healthcare alone.**
