[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=0.92) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Joey, how are you, man? Well, and you?

[@0:04](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4.7) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I'm good.

[@0:05](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=5.98) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm good. Adam Groves says hello. I'm working from Burrow today. He's got his office over there.

[@0:13](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=13.1) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Nice. Well, pass on my hellos as well. I'm probably long overdue to talk to him.

[@0:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=19.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Good to see you. My pleasure, man. My pleasure.

[@0:22](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=22.88) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

How's life treating you?

[@0:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=24.66) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Life is overall pretty good. Overall, pretty good. I could complain, but I see no reason to.

[@0:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=37.18) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. That's a way to look at it. That is a good way to look at it. Yeah.

[@0:43](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=43.4) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's you, my friend. So I want to jump in, and I would love some more time to catch up with you on another occasion.

[@0:52](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=52.78) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

That would be fantastic. You can make it work.

[@0:56](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=56.24) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That would be great. So, short version of... Are you familiar with what we are doing with you guys, with my new company, Human Glue, and this AI upskilling and maturity assessment?

[@1:11](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=71.02) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I am aware, but you know what would be amazing? Treat me like I'm five and G doesn't tell me anything.

[@1:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=79.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Fair enough. I always like hearing it back.

[@1:23](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=83.3) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Sure.

[@1:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=84.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I am creating and launching a company called Human Glue. Our focus is to help businesses and individuals map out where they are in their AI maturity and deliver upskilling when and where they need it.

And so what we're building out is a variety of things. The first thing that we're building out is something called the reality gap assessment, which is what this is, which is to...

To assess the difference between C-suite and LT vision and employee reality, to understand kind of the gaps of what's happening and where are the opportunities to change the messaging, to change processes, create more efficiencies, figure out where hidden AI talent lies and how do we level them up and kind of create kind of a COE around them.

And then what are the modules in the path forward that gets everybody on the same page?

[@2:36](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=156.62) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Got it. Yeah. Got it. So if I'm kind of re-summarizing or summarizing for you, so you're going to look at or you are looking at where we are.

And if I were trying to like really simplify it for myself, it's... ... ... Thank And basically, G or me or Boris or whomever has some vision of how we want to be using tools, right?

We want our people to be using tools to make them more efficient, better answers, faster to solutions, etc. But our desired outcome, there's probably, well, I know there is, but there's probably a gap between what we want and how it's happening.

And if it is happening, and you're going to help us kind of suss out what that gap is, why you think it is happening, and what we should probably do about that.

[@3:50](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=230.08) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yes, exactly right. Well said. Perfect. Yep. Because we need it.

[@3:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=237.78) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

We are... We are the proverbial cobbler's kid in some ways. Gee and I just got back from Scottsdale this week where we're talking to Discount Tire about what agentic shopping is going to do to them.

And we're going to start figuring it out. But I routinely am frustrated by the fact that not only have we not gotten faster at creating media plans and creative outputs, but we probably actually got this lower.

Well, there are going to be some questions that directionally we can go there in this for sure.

[@4:41](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=281.32) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

For sure. If it's okay with you, I'd love to dive in just because I have a hard stop at five.

And we may need to grab an extra 10 or 15 minutes if that's okay to wrap up. That would be all right with you.

Yeah, I am stunningly free next week.

[@4:55](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=295.96) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Okay. Fantastic. Fantastic.

[@4:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=297.94) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

You're welcome to grab.

[@5:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=300.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

As much time as you need for this, it's important. So fire away.

[@5:02](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=302.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Start asking. All right. So this is the reality gap assessment. This is the version for leadership. And this is where AI strategy meets human truth.

And we're looking for the delta in the reality versus what is aspirational. And we're using a Glue transformation model.

Look at that. It's a Glue transformation model. G is grow. So this is individual skill building and confidence development.

L is leverage, AI tool mastery and value creation. U is unite. How do we unite for social learning and organizational change?

And E is evolve, which is ongoing development and thought leadership. And so we're going to talk about where does GlueIQ sit on this transformation journey from across Growth Leverage Unite.

And I want your candid perspectives on what's working and what's not and where you see gaps. No wrong answers.

The value comes from comparing leadership perspectives and employee perspectives to look for opportunities. And what's really important to note, Joey, is that everything is confidential.

Everything is going to be aggregated, anonymized to create insight and not evaluate individuals. So what you see, what G sees, what anyone sees, maybe I'll pull some quotes here and there, but it's all going to be anonymized.

I'm not as worried about that, especially amongst the partners.

[@6:38](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=398.44) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I mean, I understand why, but I'm also not afraid of... I won't hide behind my answers. Let's just put it out.

[@6:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=414.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Fair enough. I didn't expect you would. So... Before we talk about AI specifically, can you tell me a time or about a time when GlueIQ successfully rolled out a new transformation initiative across the organization?

Could be AI, could be anything. And what made the adoption work? So I'm trying to understand how do transformation initiatives work or not work when they're rolled out in the organization?

Sort of what does that mean culturally? How does it effectively go?

[@7:33](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=453.56) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Okay. So I'll pick something recent that there was probably more mine and G's doing than anything. And I think we're still a little bit mid-stride in it.

Six months ago. Yeah, I'd say probably six months ago, we... We a decision that we were going to re-architect how the teams were organized from a business function perspective, right?

So we kind of morphed from Glue is still a creative consultancy to Glue is a creative consultancy that provides two kinds of core services.

We provide agency services where we're the operators, right? We're doing creative, we're doing media, we're doing social, and we're your agency to operate.

And that was aimed at mid-market clients. So there's a recognition there that Procter & Gamble is not going to hire Glue to be its media agency for a thousand valid reasons and for a bunch of invalid reasons.

But we have a bunch of mid-market clients that don't want to work with an Omnicom or a publicist or an IPG.

So we have this basket of stuff for them. On the other side, we are a creative consultancy that provides really high-end advisory services for marketing teams.

Are you organized properly? Are you as efficient as you should be? Do you use the right tool sets? Funny enough, some of the stuff you're asking us, right?

And on that side, we find that actually really high-end clients like Gap or DirecTV or Advanced Auto Parts value that we're not a Bain or a McKinsey, that we are incredibly marketing-oriented, but we can solve some of that for them, right?

Now, the decision we made at that point in time was that we're actually going to go from what at the time was kind of four portfolios, which were just accounts, aggregations of accounts.

And we had shared services under that to deliver with all the friction that brings. And we basically collapsed and said, you know, Maggie will run our agency services team and Boris will run

Our advisory services team and the people that deliver that work are going to move into those groups. So we would move from a kind of a centralized shared services model into Maggie's got accountability for these accounts and people and Boris's got accountability for these accounts and these people.

We're going to have less people in the center, right? Our dream was to get it to where it was functionally just me and G and the finance teams and HR teams and a few other things.

So we actually talked to people about that. We rolled it out really rapidly. One of the things that happened very early on is we as partners were 100% aligned on the idea of doing this.

But we didn't really discuss the details of how we were going to do it. We just started doing it, which created a lot of friction points.

You know, you've got the stupid little things like... We're to to You Somebody would go tell somebody that they now work for them when that was never discussed, right?

So, and the reason I'm telling you that is because I do believe that we as partners align very quickly around an idea of what we want to do.

We often leave out of it the details of the how. And, you know, like good, like people who are wired to solve problems do, we just go start doing.

So I think the effect of that has been, I think it has been pretty positive. I think our people absorbed it pretty well.

I believe that it has helped us get a lot better fiscal clarity around what's going on in the business and to be able to manage those things.

Right. So it used to be that if we lost an account, everybody would be like, well, okay, we got to get rid of some people.

Where are they coming from? Not it. Now there's no not it. If we lose an agency account, Maggie's got to figure it out financially.

If we lose an advisory account, Boris has got to figure it out financially. Now, obviously, we we we treat those things in management meetings as partners as let's align on the decisions we want to make.

But it's somebody's responsibility to go figure out and present how. So I think that has been positive from a superstructure perspective.

And I don't know how much detail you want on these things, as is. No, this is this is this is great.

[@12:48](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=768.721) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I have about 26 questions. This is a really great.

[@12:52](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=772.581) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Fire away. No, no, no.

[@12:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=774.981) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

This is this is great as a table set because you talked me through it. You've given me some of the dynamics at the partnership level, and you've explained where the friction comes up, and it's not that you don't move quickly, it's that some of the process around the how is where the friction exists, is what I'm hearing.

[@13:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=799.081) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I think that we do a really good job of aligning around the idea of where we want to take the business and the stuff we want to do.

And I think that where we get wrapped around the axle is in the details, and my perception is that is actually fairly normal, but I think one of the things I would say, and I'm sure Gaston has talked to you about the operating model stuff that he's working on right now, and the expectations and the roles and responsibilities.

We have been very lenient. with our people around expectations, and I'll try and give you some examples of that, because I think this is important for what you're trying to do.

We spent a year, just being candid, we spent a year firing and moving out people that either didn't, I don't want to say fit the culture, but that didn't fit the ethos that we wanted to exhibit, right?

Or the ones that we didn't feel like were giving us the real 40, so to speak. Or the ones where we felt like the outputs weren't where they need to be, and that usually is manifested when they bounce around clients, right?

When clients ask people off and they bounce around. But we have not, we have not in. Anyway, engendered anything in us and our people that quantifies and values the outputs.

And an example of that would be, we don't track or trace how much people actually produce and the quality of what they produce.

And that leads to an inability to use any kind of scientific formula to gauge the value of the employee.

It's all anecdotal. So for me, when we're sitting there talking about, we want to be able to onboard more clients and not have to do one-to-one hiring.

Partly because we believe that our clients and future clients, they don't really want to talk about hours and allocations.

You're seeing big, big trends around, you know, this isn't a law firm. I don't want to talk about how much you work.

I want to talk about what you produce and the outcomes you generate, right? So I want to get out of conversations where somebody's like, well, this client who's paying us 50 grand a month doesn't pay us enough for all the work that we do for them.

it's like, no, how do we create a model so that we can get really great outcomes for them for the 50 grand a month?

And they'll be happy. And, and I think all of our ways are working are very, very rooted in the past.

Um, we don't have, we have some tool sets, you know, we use motion and we use, you know, things like that, but there's no, there's no structured process.

And I, and I think I agree with G that there's gotta be some kind. of expectation with people that they find ways to utilize tools, especially the new agentic tools, and even the, or whatever, AI, whether it's agentic or generative, they find ways to use tools so that if somebody has to produce a business case for advanced auto parts for their loyalty program, and then they have to go do the same thing for El Car Wash for their loyalty program, I often find that the second business case is actually more effort than the first one.

So how do you codify that, and how do you have an expectation that our people get that into a rote process that's much faster and easier to produce those things going forward?

Even stupid , Alex, like, I feel like it's taken us for ever to produce even basic fundamental things like a high-quality email.

All right. right. High quality landing page. I often find that our people, they don't understand. Here's a thing that drives me batshit crazy.

There's two things in web commerce that are pretty rote, right? First is carousels don't work. But I swear to Christ, every time somebody gives me a new design for something, it's got carousels in it.

And the second is little things like I get landing pages and buttons are below the fold or they're not on the right side of the page and I track.

And there's just got to be a better way to structure things like that so that we design faster and more effectively and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

But again, we also have to explain to people that we have this expectation of you, that you're going to work inside this process and do this.

And the way we're going to judge you is on, you know, the outcomes you get for clients versus the fact.

That you were in 12 meetings and the fact that the client likes you. I don't know. I'm sure you're hearing a bunch of this stuff from G2, but for me, it starts to manifest like that.

[@19:09](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1149.08) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@19:12](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1152.08) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

You know, and I don't know what the answer to that is because one of the things that's hard to suss out right now is what are the right tools and where are they going?

I mean, we have a client we're trying to build their IO on. You know, we really are enamored with this cord commerce thing.

We think it's a phenomenal overlay, but it's got to actually work. Analytics, like, you know, how do I train people to use an engine to tell them where they should be looking and what they should be paying attention to so that they laser in on that instead of spending hours and hours and hours?

Here's another dumbass one. At Discount Tire, one of our larger clients, we have to produce the same deck of insights for them.

It probably takes like four humans, 80 hours to produce that. We've been doing it for a year now. Why in the hell does it take four humans, 80 hours, and four meetings to produce that thing at this point in time?

[@20:15](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1215.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That is a very crystal clear example. I couldn't agree more.

[@20:21](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1221.66) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

So the thing for me is, what are those examples? How do you pick an example and say, we're going to end this mummer's farce, right?

And we're going to move into a new way of doing this. And here's the way we're going to do it from a tool set perspective.

And we have made progress. Look, we've got everybody pretty in, you know, it's become pretty endemic and beautiful AI that that's the way we're creating our decks so that we can minimize the amount of like sloppiness around slideware, things of that nature.

But that's an example. You know, so how do you take something that's like when we produce executive decks or cubes?

This is the roadway we do it. And the engines are going to do 70% of the work for us based on the inputs.

And then we're going to spend our time on the 30% that's really important.

[@21:11](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1271.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And by the way, everything you're talking about is why so many AI initiatives are failing. They buy the tool, they get the thing, and they don't understand it.

Either it's rolled out as software, it's not thought about who's going to lead this, who's going to be the champion, who's going to hold everybody accountable.

How do we make this a learned and repeatable behavior that's iterative and measure the output, all the things that you're talking about?

That's why so many people are struggling with these new tools. And so you end up with these little pockets of excellence, but not things that are codified and embraced enterprise-wide or domain-wide or team-wide.

[@21:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1317.68) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. So why can we never get... These things, so that it's the new normal. Like that, that's the, and, and I recognize that part of this is us.

It's, you know, I think G and I are a little different. G and I believes that, or G believes that if we as partners exhibit these behaviors, that everybody will follow us.

[@22:25](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1345.24) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I don't think that's true.

[@22:28](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1348.12) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I think what's true there is we as partners need to exhibit this behavior. Because then it allows us to hold everybody else accountable when they don't.

[@22:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1357.18) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yes.

[@22:38](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1358.4) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

So like there's a, and there's a slight nuance between those two things, right? You know, and then the other thing that rattles around in my head is even if we can make something like this normal, it's like, how do we, how do we train for this?

And what, and what role do our employees play in absorbing this and utilizing it versus helping create it? You know, do we give some of these tasks to the team and say, your task is this, figure it out?

Yeah. Or do we tablets from the mountain, and I'm guessing it's something in the middle, I just don't have a good headspace for what is, what is Thou Shalt, you know, do this, and what is, I need you to tell me the right way to do this.

[@23:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1404.4) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yep, yep, yep.

[@23:30](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1410.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

This is good.

[@23:31](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1411.1) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm going to move into the next round of questions, if that's okay, but this is really good context, yeah.

So, Joey, what AI tools did you use yesterday or this week in your actual work?

[@23:51](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1431.5) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I think this week I have been really heavy in... ... ... In two specific tools because of what I've been doing this week.

So I've been really heavy in Atlas because I'm using agents to help me, or at least I have been working on using agents to help me short-circuit research and to bring back ideas.

And they can be fleshed out. And I'll give you an example. So two kind of different things. So one place where I've been using Atlas heavily is to do some comparison shopping.

So for me to be able to walk into Discount Tire and say, this is how Agente Commerce might, you know, it might be the biggest disruptor for considered purchases since Google introduced the search bar.

Right. You know, and then we're lightly having a conversation of, you know, everybody thought voice search was going to be the next big thing, and it died because it wasn't really practical.

Well, GenThick shopping is actually making voice search practical, right? so, so I'm using, I'm using Atlas agents to tell me things like, you know, like you create scripts and you go say, look, I want to buy this and I want to use that as an avenue for showing the discount client how $2 billion of their commerce won't get disrupted.

It gets shifted, right? And, and then I start asking the agent questions like how valuable, how valuable is their Treadwell system, which is one of the better rating and review entire track spec systems on the planet.

But it's behind the scenes. Right. Where it's behind the scenes and you can use Treadwell, but it's really behind the scenes.

Whereas for the agent. What I want to know from the agents is how much do you value or what do you value of that that for you needs to be brought to the front?

I'm kind of using ChatGPT and Atlas to tell me what they value and then how they would go about optimizing for this.

Right. So that's one way that I'm using Atlas. The other way I'm using Atlas is we do a lot of conversion rate optimization consulting.

And I've got two open asks right now at two companies who want to know how they can improve their conversion rates.

So I'm basically creating a GPT that for me is this is going to be my standard process for CRO.

I want that. I want this thing to go gather all the info to go look at the competition to take some inputs for me around where the day.

DataSits right now, and then to identify for me the places where there's a lot of juice for the squeeze so that I don't have to go do it, right?

And then I'm sitting, and then so basically I set up that GPT, and then Gaston and I were actually live working on this in Scottsdale.

And then the next one I said is, okay, now take all this information and turn it into a detailed document for me.

And the reason I want to turn it into a detailed document is because I want to make sure that the detailed document describes all the stuff that has to be done and all the stuff that has to be presented, right?

Now, the thing I'm working on today and tomorrow is, okay, now we're going to start sharpening these details and data, and I want to start creating the slides to drive the meeting, right?

So that's an example for me this week that's been very, very top of mind is those two kind of things.

Now, I'm going to, while these slides are being done, I'm co-kind of... I'm creating a template in beautiful AI so I can connect these things and so I can basically have it driven from there to here.

And then the goal would be I can use this to create 80% of a good, good conversion rate optimization conversation with prioritized areas and expected values.

And then the only thing I'm focusing on is turning the 30 slides into 10 for the executive summary. then eventually I'll get something to, you know, to get that further down the path.

Yeah. Um, I mean, that's, I'm here. My wife clamoring around in here. She's going listen to this while I was doing that on the side.

created a little agent to find stocking stuffers for her. I fed it in information about her, her likes or dislikes, what her business is like and the damn thing.

[@28:49](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1729.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's awesome. Yeah.

[@28:51](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1731.12) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

And I was doing that because I wanted to play and see how it operates and see how it actually functions.

It had much more difficulty doing that than it did buying tires. And I think it's because with tires, you can get down to just, I like that price.

I like that option. Can you throw those into a cart for me? And then all I have to do is the last mile, the credit card.

Whereas the example with her, since it's casting a wider net, there may be 93 different sites that it's coming up with ideas on.

And it was kind of struggling with, it can't just throw all that into one checkout process for you. So it was struggling a little bit, but that for me is how I'm trying to speed up the rote things we do in strategy, the routine things we do in strategy.

And I want to take things like, you know, client wants to justify a bigger media spend. Here's your process, right?

And here's your tools. Client wants a business case for... And client wants, you know, a weekly optimization plan, you know, client wants, so I want five or six, the five or six things we do repetitively in strategy.

I want to create this and then I want to load it into the Glue, the Glue corporate workspace and say, hey, here are the GPTs for this.

And then let people, you know, and then train people to use them and then let them hone them and perfect them.

Is that what you're looking for? That like that kind of thing? Yeah, that's fantastic.

[@30:29](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1829.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's, that's really, really good. And I guess the next question I have is, if you could have an AI expert sit with you for two hours and teach you one thing about AI with no one else watching, what would you want to learn?

[@30:45](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1845.26) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Oh, I would want to learn how, how, how the machine decides what is credible and valuable. And when it returns things that look alike, how does it decide that this one is what I present versus this one?

Because that would teach me how to talk to clients about the way they optimize. It's like, you know, for 20 years, there have been teams of people who have been, you know, who have been toiling away trying to, you know, trying to reverse engineer the algorithm for Google.

Right. And in that SEO world that, you know, they do that. the people that are good at it, like, they're valued.

Like, for me, it would be that. It would be, you know, it would really be that. And even if it was just one engine, mean, eventually we have to learn what ChatGPT likes versus what Claude likes versus what Grok likes, you know.

Yep, yep, yep, yep.

[@31:56](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1916.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But for me,

[@32:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1920.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

For this, I'd probably pick ChatGPT because I think Atlas is going to be pretty far ahead. I know Gemini is getting ahead on the shopping part a little bit, but I think Google is going to be very low to disrupt their paid ad platform so much right now.

But for me, it would be like ChatGPT, would be like, tell me when somebody's shopping for something, how Atlas decides that this versus this is in the initial result sets and gets presented.

Why did it like that? You know, why did it like this product on Walmart's page better than the same product on Amazon's page?

You know, like for me, that would be a fascinating thing to start to kind of unearth how this stuff works for our clients.

[@32:42](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1962.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's such a good answer, and it's an answer that I have not heard from anybody else. So you get a gold star on that one.

It's good. It's really good. What else? What am I going to ask you?

[@32:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1974.38) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I mean, eventually I'd love to have an agent that will. We'll do a damn good job of telling me how to organize myself and making sure that I am advancing things.

But the most valuable thing for Glue for me right now would be something like that, because that's the hard thing.

If I had a number two, and I don't know if this is an actual correct answer for what you asked.

I'd pick something that gets repetitively produced at GlueIQ to help me understand how to have this produced by an engine and just merely reviewed.

I want the human to put inputs in, walk away, have it get produced, and then I want the human to review it and tweak it.

I don't want the human to make it, right? Because to me, you know, it's the old adage of AI is not going to take your job.

People who use AI are going to take your job. That's kind of the... I'd like to understand how someone who builds the engine sees the way to do that.

Like, what are the real pressure points to push on? And I'm hoping this is something that you're going to do for us, which is if Glue's got to start with three to five things and get the people to use engines to make those things, what are those things?

Yep.

[@34:32](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2072.64) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yep. What are those tools and what are those activities and deliverables? Yep.

[@34:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2077.7) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, like... 100%. Project plans. You know, like, here's one that drives me crazy. I don't have a screen at GlueIQ so that on Monday morning I can look at that says, here's the critical deliverables that GlueIQ has to make and deliver this week.

Like that doesn't exist.

[@35:04](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2104.94) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

How do you get to something like that?

[@35:07](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2107.64) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

And then how do I have the agent keep track of that and do the notifications, right? Tell somebody when they're behind, you know, or look at their calendar and add spaces to actually work.

Like, I don't know. There's a there there somehow.

[@35:25](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2125.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We just built an internal agentic built project management tool. That's pretty cool. So, and I feel you, it's like having something like that, where it's all visualized, where there's kind of a weekly, monthly, you know, annual or quarterly roadmap.

I mean, it's, it's very helpful, very helpful. Compared to other executives, you know, in similar roles, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency?

Ahead, behind, or on par?

[@36:05](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2165.24) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Ooh. I'm certainly behind Gaston. But I also believe that that's probably going to be a perpetual state of truth, because he's just...

First of all, he needs some more hobbies in his life, but he's latched on to this, and he's really rabid.

I am probably ahead of... I'm probably on par with Matt and ahead of the other partners. If I look at my clients...

If I look at my clients probably ahead... mind. am at So And I think a lot of them use AI in their life to make it easier, but I think it's cursory AI.

see a lot of people talking to their phones like, chat GPT, tell me this.

[@37:12](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2232.88) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But I don't know that it ever gets past that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm doing the stocking stuffer thing that I just did kind of scenario.

[@37:20](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2240.94) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

No, that's good.

[@37:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2244.5) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The follow-up would be, what's the most sophisticated thing you've done with AI where the result truly impressed you?

[@37:48](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2268.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Wow, what a fantastic question. I think the thing that we just did Tuesday morning in Scottsdale, like, after a lot of work...

Just being able to sit down with a client and say, this is the way somebody's going to shop for your product in the future.

And I saw a variation in what got returned with the same script 30 minutes after I ran through with a test.

And I think the variation was improved. So I was very impressed that on the same script, the engine didn't go through exactly the same steps or process.

It seemed to self-replicate or self-improve, right? So you got a better output, yeah. I got a better output, and being able to sit there with a client and say, I ran through this with other people watching 30 minutes ago, and it did X, Y, and Z better this time.

All right. It was actually pretty impressive. I mean, there's little, I think there, other than that, there's little things that impress me.

think the fact that you can continue to prompt and hone in AI pretty quickly is actually awesome, right? I need to see AI produce polished things better, but I think, yeah, I think that impressed me.

The other place I would say that it's impressed me is I was doing some homework, just some research, and this is a general, I was impressed.

I was impressed at how much faster something like Atlas, ChatGPT, has made me at finding. The right nuggets of data, verifying that they're credible, and then stashing them away to use them.

And, you know, you know how hard research is, even with Google. I couldn't believe what's the trusted source, like, you know, how do you get the things, like, if there isn't an industry code, right, for this industry.

You almost could never get to the research, you had to cobble it together, but I've been impressed with ChatGPT's ability to actually, you know, say I need a subset of aftermarket auto parts, and I need you to hone in on that.

And that might mean you have to go to other places. And then lastly, what I've just been really impressed with is what it can absorb.

Now, I know, I know that the workspace is still working. on memory, but I've been pretty impressed with how much it can store and maintain.

[@41:10](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2470.76) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Those have been my big things.

[@41:12](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2472.68) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

mean, oh, in the stocking stuffer, the damn thing came back at some point and asked me what the size of the stocking was so that it can show something.

Wow.

[@41:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2484.44) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. That's fantastic. Yeah. That was a good one, too.

[@41:29](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2489.5) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah.

[@41:33](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2493.82) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Next question is, Joey, you had to bet your job on one AI-driven innovation for GlueIQ, what would it be and why?

[@41:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2514.84) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Can I pick one client facing and one internal? Sure.

[@41:59](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2519.84) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Sure.

[@42:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2520.01) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

On the client-facing side, it would be the agentic commerce, and it would be like the thing that, you never heard this, but the thing that Stripe is about to do, where they're going to announce a partnership with Perplexity and ChatGPT and one other.

They are, Stripe is basically going to have an agentic marketplace, so if you load your product feeds into Stripe, people can complete the transaction inside of the agentic interface, and then Stripe just passes you the information to fulfill.

But think about it, it's like they're replicating what you can do with an Instagram storefront right now, or with a Shopify Plus inside of it, so they're going to have an MCP and an ACP.

I mean, like for me... The ability to understand and bet on agentic commerce, this is going to be on the scale of like the third-party marketplaces, like Walmart's marketplace and Amazon's marketplace.

So I would say that Glue has got to bet the farm there because it is going to be the newest commerce and marketing frontier.

Because I also know that when that starts happening, somebody's putting ads in that.

[@43:30](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2610.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And Stripe is doing amazing things. It's funny. So I needed to set up a new corporation. And I was looking at a few different registered agents, one of which I'd used.

And I said, there's got to be a faster, better way. So, of course, I'd just jump into Claude. This is what I'm trying to do.

It's a good way to do this. And it recommended this service that Stripe has called Stripe Atlas. this. to receptives.

So, broken we'll ant In Joey, set up a Delaware C-Corp in seven minutes. Seven minutes using their platform.

[@44:14](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2654.21) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

That's actually another interesting thing. My wife just started getting all kinds of messages about having to renew her copyright for her business.

Doing that, even with the ID.me stuff, it's a frigging nightmare. But if you want an attorney to do it, it's a minimum of $500 or $600.

So come to find out, she doesn't have to do it for another year, but another three or four months, I might just create an agent and say, here's what I need to go do.

And I bet it's going to get it done.

[@44:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2697.13) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. I think I think lawyers, especially people coming right out of law school, are pretty .

[@45:11](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2711.43) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

You have to wonder, like G had this whole thing the other day, and I'm not sure I believe him yet, because I don't know that the agent has the bedside manner or knows how to talk to people, but he was having a whole diatribe about how therapists might be really screwed.

[@45:30](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2730.58) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The number one use case of personal use for ChatGPT is therapists, as of Harvard's review in Q2 of this year.

Number one. Yeah. And I don't want to go down this rabbit hole because I've got a bunch more stuff to ask you, but the quick version is, it's $20 a month.

It's trained on the entire corpus of human psychology. You can ask. Ask for whatever type of therapist you want.

You know, do you want a therapist, you know, act as a family therapist, act as a child psychologist, act as a therapist with a specialty in, you know, midlife crisis trauma, like whatever it is.

And now you have your specialist. It's on demand. And there's no judgment. And so people aren't working. And that's the thing is that people will go in.

And, you know, I had a therapist many years ago when I was ending my first marriage, and she crossed a boundary with me, and I'll never forget it.

Like, she'd shared something with my wife's therapist and the whole thing, and it was just, like, one of those, like, what the moments.

[@46:48](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2808.86) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

And I think that front side, to your point, it's, like, setting HIPAA and, you know. backspace, hard as What may come with legal and structural guidelines, you think about therapy, think about fast-twitch legal advice, investment advice, there's no way you can't tell me that these engines, and I'm sure it's already getting used this way, right?

Isn't going to do a better job than a human of telling you how to move money around based on what trends are happening, right?

So yeah, I mean, that to me is going to be really, really fascinating, like stepping forward. The internal thing for Glue, so we can keep rolling.

I would say two things. Two parts of the same coin. One is, I would bet my job on figuring out how to produce analysis faster and better, actually really truly doing analysis, and the other would be creative production.

Right. So for me, it would be on the outside, it would be the big agentic commerce bet. And on the inside, it would be two core things that we do that we just need to do faster.

And we either need to be able to do more of it with the same number of humans, or we need to be able to do the same amount at a higher quality with less humans.

[@48:50](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2930.25) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Who are your top three AI fluent people in the organization? Not by title, but by actual capability. So, could be within the LT, the folks you just named, could be individual employees, top three AI fluent folks.

I mean, G's definitely probably at the top of the heap.

[@49:14](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2954.95) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I'm not sure that anybody in the organization could challenge him right now in terms of breadth or scale. Let me think.

Sorry, I'm just doing a mental, like, run around. I would probably put Matt Kajawa in that, though I think different kinds of AI fluent.

I think G is AI advancement fluent and use case fluent. He both understands the landscape, and he is actually doing stuff at a much broader depth.

I think where Matt is excelling is really on the tools themselves and the use cases for the tools. So he's really getting into where is Figma going, and how are they thinking about this, and where is Builder going, and how are they thinking about this.

He's really getting into how AI is going to disrupt the traditional product and SI process.

[@50:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3037.57) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I think those two are certainly doing a good job of that.

[@50:40](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3040.93) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

When you get behind that, I don't know. I don't know. I don't, I don't know that I have an answer for a third.

I think there's probably, and I'm not going to say myself, I, I, I think you could probably say I'm there.

But I'm not going to answer that way. I don't know, I think you'd have a, you'd have a smaller group of four or five people that, that would be kind of challenging for the third to the seventh slot, so to speak.

I don't, I don't know of anyone that is walking through the door and using AI repetitively throughout the day to do their job better.

So that dovetails perfectly into the next question, which is what percentage of your people would you say are genuinely AI capable today?

the way we need them to be? Hello? One in five? 20%?

[@52:05](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3125.61) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@52:07](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3127.23) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I would guess maybe one in five people actually use some kind of AI tool each day to do something faster and more effectively.

[@52:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3139.03) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. I like the way you said that, too, because I think that is a really good rubric. Did you use it today to do something faster, better, and more effectively?

Looking out 18 months, what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today? Or put another way, what would Sam Altman or another tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit the gap?

[@52:53](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3173.53) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Oh. Without question. One, I would say workflow, some kind of workflow tool and some kind of output planning and output tracking.

And those are kind of two sides of the same coin, so to speak, right? 18 months from now, 100% of the things that we do repetitively must have a defined process, a defined tool to do them, even if the humans are using that tool.

And 100% of them, we should be able to noticeably know that it is faster and more effective to produce that output.

And I would argue it's not even 18 months. I candidly think that it's like a six-month thing. Yeah.

[@53:58](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3238.47) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I don't want be arguing with clients.

[@54:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3240.01) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I haven't seen any more about hours and allocations. I just want to be capable of overwhelming them with good stuff.

[@54:07](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3247.99) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

By the way, I was able to push my next meeting 15 minutes. So if you can go 15 more, we can keep rolling if that's okay.

[@54:15](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3255.73) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

It should be okay.

[@54:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3259.39) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

How are you currently measuring ROI on AI investments?

[@54:23](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3263.89) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Not. Not. I think we believe that the investment in beautiful AI has made it faster and more effective for us to produce decks and executive summaries and repetitive things, but I don't know that we've measured that.

And we struggle with the same thing that every SI or consultancy or agency has struggled. The effort always fills up the allocation.

So... You know, if we put a marker in the ground that said, look, if three months ago we had said on Discount Tire, here's the amount of energy and here's the hours, here's the raw hours we spend creating the deliverables every week.

If we had benchmarked that, I could look at it now and say, are we getting better at that? But I don't think we know those two answers.

I think we have to know those two answers. Sorry, I, we have to. I mean, don't like, can you ever really get down to how long it took you to make a banner or how long it took you to make an email or a landing page or how long it took you to make a strategy deck?

I don't know the answer to that, but I, I would say that we need to look at the hours we spend on clients where we have monthly.

recurring revenue, and it should take us less hours in the future, no matter what the discipline or domain is on this client, to actually keep them happy and produce what we need to produce.

That is a thing I think we could measure. Does that help? Yeah, that's great.

[@56:22](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3382.41) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I put this in the notes.

[@56:27](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3387.83) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

We have to prove that how many ever hours a month we spent on RBC or L-Car Wash or Discount Tire in 2025, we can produce more and better output in 2026 for less hours.

I think that we have to. Or none, yeah.

[@56:53](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3413.25) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Who is ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use in the organization? And how does Does that accountability work?

[@57:03](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3423.19) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Wow. Okay, let me think about. So how, trying to think about what would get us sued. The most problematic thing for us, I think, would be on the creative production side.

That generally has the highest likelihood of getting, you know, use infringement or patent trolls. I think it starts with, I think it starts with Noel and Gaston on the creative front to make sure that we can use AI effectively.

Especially generative AI to produce work, but also have a good process for vetting that that work meets the right use standards.

You know, because we can't get into an issue where we put something in the wild and then realize that somebody else owns that music, or we didn't license it, or somebody owns that image and we didn't license it.

So, like, to me, that's the place probably most desperately in need of something like that now. Right? I'm trying to think of another scenario.

Because this isn't like school. And it's not like getting a doctoral thesis. There's a high unlikelihood that you have some plagiaristic outcome that happens.

In our business, often you have to cite things because the client wants to know that they're from credible sources.

You don't get in trouble for, you don't get in trouble for like you're passing something of yours off and it's somebody else's.

That's not usually the challenge. Usually the challenge is, like I said, on those creative fronts. I'm trying to think of another scenario that really might be problematic for us.

I would be more worried about client information or Glue information being utilized in a non-private space. That's an interesting one.

I don't know that we have this person from being candid with you when you think about it that way.

Because we don't have a COO, and we don't have a privacy officer, and we don't have guidelines like that.

don't have guidelines that say, thou shalt never upload Discount Tire's marketing budget into Quad to get reactions to it.

Now, theoretically, all of the AI engines say that they never use your information, but Google used to say that too.

So I don't think that there is a person. I think there has to be a person.

So I would start on two fronts.

[@1:00:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3637.11) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I would start on the creative side with no LNG to define the process and what tools do we use for this, and then to make sure that the teams are trained that they have to do this.

And then I might have a producer on the backside of that process that's doing pre-live QA that's just vetting that everything is okay to use.

So how about that? Gaston Noel, to define the process for creative and the tool we use, a creative producer who is the last line of defense for checking and vetting the things.

And then I think we need some kind of internal governance for Glue and clients with pure information.

[@1:01:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3684.53) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's good. I like it. What AI tool or initiative did your organization invest in but ultimately abandon what happened and what did you learn?

[@1:01:53](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3713.09) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I don't know that I would call it an AI tool, though I think they may argue. That, I'm trying to, blanking on the system that we used before we moved to Productive.

Before we moved to Productive, we had another agency management software that I just don't, I think we've had a couple of instances between that, and I'm going to remember the name of it, and like HubSpot, where I'm sitting here renewing all of our HubSpot licenses in use right now.

And in both those instances, I don't think the tool was at fault. I think we were at fault because we didn't actually utilize the really promising things in the tool well.

We almost acted like, because it could do all these things, that it would just... We do those things. And I also think in any instance where a tool fails, it's because there is no expectation of the way it gets used.

Right? So if we decide to abandon HubSpot, because it's not doing what we want from a contact tracking, from a BD perspective, etc., that has to go somewhere.

Yeah. We have the same issues wherever it goes, unless it's, you know, whatever, it's my if we don't produce the reports and follow up on the things and people don't input the stuff correctly.

So I would say we have a couple of instances where we have started and stopped. I also think we have a tool called Motion that we're supposed to be using for creative variation and for testing and things like that.

And I, I'm not sure that we're actually really using it. Yeah.

[@1:03:59](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3839.45) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Well, I think we have it, and because we have it, we think people use it, but I don't know that we're really using it.

So let's... You'll fail, too. No, no, no, that's really good context. I'm going to do one more question, and then if we could grab some time next week, that would be fantastic, and we can wrap this up, if that's okay.

Okay. You've given some really great answers, and we've gone deeper, which I love, and I really appreciate, and there's a lot of value in what you've shared, Joey, so thank you.

Can you give me a specific example where AI dramatically changed your delivery timeline? What was possible that wasn't before?

Oh, I...

[@1:05:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3900.01) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I, because of a combination of writer's block and another client having a major issue, I was forced to create the decklet and the presentation for Tuesday morning, functionally Monday while I was flying.

And if I didn't have Atlas and Beautiful AI, I'm not sure I wouldn't have gotten it done. I would have gotten it done.

It just wouldn't have been nearly as effective. Yeah. A very recent kind of thing there. Unfortunately, I find myself going back to kind of the core tools.

It's still at this point in time, it's BOD or it's ChatGPT or the new Atlas browser that will do most of the lifting helping me get these things done right now.

So I am working inside of the Atlas workspaces to actually, like I said, create common GPTs so that people can run agents, but we're not quite there yet.

But I think we're going to get better, but it goes back to having the three or five things and then just saying here, but that's my example from this week.

That's great. Struggled. How does, let's just take a quick look at next week. What's good for you to grab just a little more time?

Maybe grab another 30 minutes. may not take us that long, but just 30 minutes would be great.

All right. I will send that over momentarily. And I will see you on Monday. And thank you, man. It's great to see you, dude.

And, you know, really just so appreciate how thoughtful your answers are. And it's great. It validates a lot of the things that I've already heard.

But you've also added some really interesting nuance that is important. And as one of the, even though you don't consider yourself among the three AI wise men, I think you definitely are one.

I think that I am catching up quickly.

[@1:07:58](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4078.15) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

It's just, it's what's going to be really. Really interesting, when you come back with recommendations, it's going to be very, very important that we as partners explain to people, here's the recommendations we got, we are going to do those things.

You have no choice. Not only will you not get in the way of this, but you will adopt and use it or you have no place here.

And I think that's the thing that we really need to transition to rapidly. know you can't rush the process, but I'm very excited to see the very kind of tactical, detailed recommendations of what to go do.

Because I think that's just, we have to, we have no choice. Nope. Well, hey, have a great weekend if I don't talk to you.

It was great seeing and talking to you again, and I look forward to some more Monday.

That would be great. So, short version of... Are you familiar with what we are doing with you guys, with my new company, Human Glue, and this AI upskilling and maturity assessment?

[@1:11](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=71.02) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I am aware, but you know what would be amazing? Treat me like I'm five and G doesn't tell me anything.

[@1:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=79.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Fair enough. I always like hearing it back.

[@1:23](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=83.3) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Sure.

[@1:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=84.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I am creating and launching a company called Human Glue. Our focus is to help businesses and individuals map out where they are in their AI maturity and deliver upskilling when and where they need it.

And so what we're building out is a variety of things. The first thing that we're building out is something called the reality gap assessment, which is what this is, which is to...

To assess the difference between C-suite and LT vision and employee reality, to understand kind of the gaps of what's happening and where are the opportunities to change the messaging, to change processes, create more efficiencies, figure out where hidden AI talent lies and how do we level them up and kind of create kind of a COE around them.

And then what are the modules in the path forward that gets everybody on the same page?

[@2:36](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=156.62) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Got it. Yeah. Got it. So if I'm kind of re-summarizing or summarizing for you, so you're going to look at or you are looking at where we are.

And if I were trying to like really simplify it for myself, it's... ... ... Thank And basically, G or me or Boris or whomever has some vision of how we want to be using tools, right?

We want our people to be using tools to make them more efficient, better answers, faster to solutions, etc. But our desired outcome, there's probably, well, I know there is, but there's probably a gap between what we want and how it's happening.

And if it is happening, and you're going to help us kind of suss out what that gap is, why you think it is happening, and what we should probably do about that.

[@3:50](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=230.08) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yes, exactly right. Well said. Perfect. Yep. Because we need it.

[@3:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=237.78) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

We are... We are the proverbial cobbler's kid in some ways. Gee and I just got back from Scottsdale this week where we're talking to Discount Tire about what agentic shopping is going to do to them.

And we're going to start figuring it out. But I routinely am frustrated by the fact that not only have we not gotten faster at creating media plans and creative outputs, but we probably actually got this lower.

Well, there are going to be some questions that directionally we can go there in this for sure.

[@4:41](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=281.32) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

For sure. If it's okay with you, I'd love to dive in just because I have a hard stop at five.

And we may need to grab an extra 10 or 15 minutes if that's okay to wrap up. That would be all right with you.

Yeah, I am stunningly free next week.

[@4:55](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=295.96) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Okay. Fantastic. Fantastic.

[@4:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=297.94) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

You're welcome to grab.

[@5:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=300.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

As much time as you need for this, it's important. So fire away.

[@5:02](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=302.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Start asking. All right. So this is the reality gap assessment. This is the version for leadership. And this is where AI strategy meets human truth.

And we're looking for the delta in the reality versus what is aspirational. And we're using a Glue transformation model.

Look at that. It's a Glue transformation model. G is grow. So this is individual skill building and confidence development.

L is leverage, AI tool mastery and value creation. U is unite. How do we unite for social learning and organizational change?

And E is evolve, which is ongoing development and thought leadership. And so we're going to talk about where does GlueIQ sit on this transformation journey from across Growth Leverage Unite.

And I want your candid perspectives on what's working and what's not and where you see gaps. No wrong answers.

The value comes from comparing leadership perspectives and employee perspectives to look for opportunities. And what's really important to note, Joey, is that everything is confidential.

Everything is going to be aggregated, anonymized to create insight and not evaluate individuals. So what you see, what G sees, what anyone sees, maybe I'll pull some quotes here and there, but it's all going to be anonymized.

I'm not as worried about that, especially amongst the partners.

[@6:38](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=398.44) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I mean, I understand why, but I'm also not afraid of... I won't hide behind my answers. Let's just put it out.

[@6:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=414.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Fair enough. I didn't expect you would. So... Before we talk about AI specifically, can you tell me a time or about a time when GlueIQ successfully rolled out a new transformation initiative across the organization?

Could be AI, could be anything. And what made the adoption work? So I'm trying to understand how do transformation initiatives work or not work when they're rolled out in the organization?

Sort of what does that mean culturally? How does it effectively go?

[@7:33](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=453.56) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Okay. So I'll pick something recent that there was probably more mine and G's doing than anything. And I think we're still a little bit mid-stride in it.

Six months ago. Yeah, I'd say probably six months ago, we... We a decision that we were going to re-architect how the teams were organized from a business function perspective, right?

So we kind of morphed from Glue is still a creative consultancy to Glue is a creative consultancy that provides two kinds of core services.

We provide agency services where we're the operators, right? We're doing creative, we're doing media, we're doing social, and we're your agency to operate.

And that was aimed at mid-market clients. So there's a recognition there that Procter & Gamble is not going to hire Glue to be its media agency for a thousand valid reasons and for a bunch of invalid reasons.

But we have a bunch of mid-market clients that don't want to work with an Omnicom or a publicist or an IPG.

So we have this basket of stuff for them. On the other side, we are a creative consultancy that provides really high-end advisory services for marketing teams.

Are you organized properly? Are you as efficient as you should be? Do you use the right tool sets? Funny enough, some of the stuff you're asking us, right?

And on that side, we find that actually really high-end clients like Gap or DirecTV or Advanced Auto Parts value that we're not a Bain or a McKinsey, that we are incredibly marketing-oriented, but we can solve some of that for them, right?

Now, the decision we made at that point in time was that we're actually going to go from what at the time was kind of four portfolios, which were just accounts, aggregations of accounts.

And we had shared services under that to deliver with all the friction that brings. And we basically collapsed and said, you know, Maggie will run our agency services team and Boris will run

Our advisory services team and the people that deliver that work are going to move into those groups. So we would move from a kind of a centralized shared services model into Maggie's got accountability for these accounts and people and Boris's got accountability for these accounts and these people.

We're going to have less people in the center, right? Our dream was to get it to where it was functionally just me and G and the finance teams and HR teams and a few other things.

So we actually talked to people about that. We rolled it out really rapidly. One of the things that happened very early on is we as partners were 100% aligned on the idea of doing this.

But we didn't really discuss the details of how we were going to do it. We just started doing it, which created a lot of friction points.

You know, you've got the stupid little things like... We're to to You Somebody would go tell somebody that they now work for them when that was never discussed, right?

So, and the reason I'm telling you that is because I do believe that we as partners align very quickly around an idea of what we want to do.

We often leave out of it the details of the how. And, you know, like good, like people who are wired to solve problems do, we just go start doing.

So I think the effect of that has been, I think it has been pretty positive. I think our people absorbed it pretty well.

I believe that it has helped us get a lot better fiscal clarity around what's going on in the business and to be able to manage those things.

Right. So it used to be that if we lost an account, everybody would be like, well, okay, we got to get rid of some people.

Where are they coming from? Not it. Now there's no not it. If we lose an agency account, Maggie's got to figure it out financially.

If we lose an advisory account, Boris has got to figure it out financially. Now, obviously, we we we treat those things in management meetings as partners as let's align on the decisions we want to make.

But it's somebody's responsibility to go figure out and present how. So I think that has been positive from a superstructure perspective.

And I don't know how much detail you want on these things, as is. No, this is this is this is great.

[@12:48](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=768.721) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I have about 26 questions. This is a really great.

[@12:52](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=772.581) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Fire away. No, no, no.

[@12:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=774.981) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

This is this is great as a table set because you talked me through it. You've given me some of the dynamics at the partnership level, and you've explained where the friction comes up, and it's not that you don't move quickly, it's that some of the process around the how is where the friction exists, is what I'm hearing.

[@13:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=799.081) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I think that we do a really good job of aligning around the idea of where we want to take the business and the stuff we want to do.

And I think that where we get wrapped around the axle is in the details, and my perception is that is actually fairly normal, but I think one of the things I would say, and I'm sure Gaston has talked to you about the operating model stuff that he's working on right now, and the expectations and the roles and responsibilities.

We have been very lenient. with our people around expectations, and I'll try and give you some examples of that, because I think this is important for what you're trying to do.

We spent a year, just being candid, we spent a year firing and moving out people that either didn't, I don't want to say fit the culture, but that didn't fit the ethos that we wanted to exhibit, right?

Or the ones that we didn't feel like were giving us the real 40, so to speak. Or the ones where we felt like the outputs weren't where they need to be, and that usually is manifested when they bounce around clients, right?

When clients ask people off and they bounce around. But we have not, we have not in. Anyway, engendered anything in us and our people that quantifies and values the outputs.

And an example of that would be, we don't track or trace how much people actually produce and the quality of what they produce.

And that leads to an inability to use any kind of scientific formula to gauge the value of the employee.

It's all anecdotal. So for me, when we're sitting there talking about, we want to be able to onboard more clients and not have to do one-to-one hiring.

Partly because we believe that our clients and future clients, they don't really want to talk about hours and allocations.

You're seeing big, big trends around, you know, this isn't a law firm. I don't want to talk about how much you work.

I want to talk about what you produce and the outcomes you generate, right? So I want to get out of conversations where somebody's like, well, this client who's paying us 50 grand a month doesn't pay us enough for all the work that we do for them.

it's like, no, how do we create a model so that we can get really great outcomes for them for the 50 grand a month?

And they'll be happy. And, and I think all of our ways are working are very, very rooted in the past.

Um, we don't have, we have some tool sets, you know, we use motion and we use, you know, things like that, but there's no, there's no structured process.

And I, and I think I agree with G that there's gotta be some kind. of expectation with people that they find ways to utilize tools, especially the new agentic tools, and even the, or whatever, AI, whether it's agentic or generative, they find ways to use tools so that if somebody has to produce a business case for advanced auto parts for their loyalty program, and then they have to go do the same thing for El Car Wash for their loyalty program, I often find that the second business case is actually more effort than the first one.

So how do you codify that, and how do you have an expectation that our people get that into a rote process that's much faster and easier to produce those things going forward?

Even stupid , Alex, like, I feel like it's taken us for ever to produce even basic fundamental things like a high-quality email.

All right. right. High quality landing page. I often find that our people, they don't understand. Here's a thing that drives me batshit crazy.

There's two things in web commerce that are pretty rote, right? First is carousels don't work. But I swear to Christ, every time somebody gives me a new design for something, it's got carousels in it.

And the second is little things like I get landing pages and buttons are below the fold or they're not on the right side of the page and I track.

And there's just got to be a better way to structure things like that so that we design faster and more effectively and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

But again, we also have to explain to people that we have this expectation of you, that you're going to work inside this process and do this.

And the way we're going to judge you is on, you know, the outcomes you get for clients versus the fact.

That you were in 12 meetings and the fact that the client likes you. I don't know. I'm sure you're hearing a bunch of this stuff from G2, but for me, it starts to manifest like that.

[@19:09](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1149.08) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@19:12](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1152.08) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

You know, and I don't know what the answer to that is because one of the things that's hard to suss out right now is what are the right tools and where are they going?

I mean, we have a client we're trying to build their IO on. You know, we really are enamored with this cord commerce thing.

We think it's a phenomenal overlay, but it's got to actually work. Analytics, like, you know, how do I train people to use an engine to tell them where they should be looking and what they should be paying attention to so that they laser in on that instead of spending hours and hours and hours?

Here's another dumbass one. At Discount Tire, one of our larger clients, we have to produce the same deck of insights for them.

It probably takes like four humans, 80 hours to produce that. We've been doing it for a year now. Why in the hell does it take four humans, 80 hours, and four meetings to produce that thing at this point in time?

[@20:15](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1215.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That is a very crystal clear example. I couldn't agree more.

[@20:21](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1221.66) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

So the thing for me is, what are those examples? How do you pick an example and say, we're going to end this mummer's farce, right?

And we're going to move into a new way of doing this. And here's the way we're going to do it from a tool set perspective.

And we have made progress. Look, we've got everybody pretty in, you know, it's become pretty endemic and beautiful AI that that's the way we're creating our decks so that we can minimize the amount of like sloppiness around slideware, things of that nature.

But that's an example. You know, so how do you take something that's like when we produce executive decks or cubes?

This is the roadway we do it. And the engines are going to do 70% of the work for us based on the inputs.

And then we're going to spend our time on the 30% that's really important.

[@21:11](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1271.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And by the way, everything you're talking about is why so many AI initiatives are failing. They buy the tool, they get the thing, and they don't understand it.

Either it's rolled out as software, it's not thought about who's going to lead this, who's going to be the champion, who's going to hold everybody accountable.

How do we make this a learned and repeatable behavior that's iterative and measure the output, all the things that you're talking about?

That's why so many people are struggling with these new tools. And so you end up with these little pockets of excellence, but not things that are codified and embraced enterprise-wide or domain-wide or team-wide.

[@21:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1317.68) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. So why can we never get... These things, so that it's the new normal. Like that, that's the, and, and I recognize that part of this is us.

It's, you know, I think G and I are a little different. G and I believes that, or G believes that if we as partners exhibit these behaviors, that everybody will follow us.

[@22:25](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1345.24) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I don't think that's true.

[@22:28](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1348.12) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I think what's true there is we as partners need to exhibit this behavior. Because then it allows us to hold everybody else accountable when they don't.

[@22:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1357.18) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yes.

[@22:38](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1358.4) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

So like there's a, and there's a slight nuance between those two things, right? You know, and then the other thing that rattles around in my head is even if we can make something like this normal, it's like, how do we, how do we train for this?

And what, and what role do our employees play in absorbing this and utilizing it versus helping create it? You know, do we give some of these tasks to the team and say, your task is this, figure it out?

Yeah. Or do we tablets from the mountain, and I'm guessing it's something in the middle, I just don't have a good headspace for what is, what is Thou Shalt, you know, do this, and what is, I need you to tell me the right way to do this.

[@23:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1404.4) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yep, yep, yep.

[@23:30](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1410.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

This is good.

[@23:31](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1411.1) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'm going to move into the next round of questions, if that's okay, but this is really good context, yeah.

So, Joey, what AI tools did you use yesterday or this week in your actual work?

[@23:51](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1431.5) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I think this week I have been really heavy in... ... ... In two specific tools because of what I've been doing this week.

So I've been really heavy in Atlas because I'm using agents to help me, or at least I have been working on using agents to help me short-circuit research and to bring back ideas.

And they can be fleshed out. And I'll give you an example. So two kind of different things. So one place where I've been using Atlas heavily is to do some comparison shopping.

So for me to be able to walk into Discount Tire and say, this is how Agente Commerce might, you know, it might be the biggest disruptor for considered purchases since Google introduced the search bar.

Right. You know, and then we're lightly having a conversation of, you know, everybody thought voice search was going to be the next big thing, and it died because it wasn't really practical.

Well, GenThick shopping is actually making voice search practical, right? so, so I'm using, I'm using Atlas agents to tell me things like, you know, like you create scripts and you go say, look, I want to buy this and I want to use that as an avenue for showing the discount client how $2 billion of their commerce won't get disrupted.

It gets shifted, right? And, and then I start asking the agent questions like how valuable, how valuable is their Treadwell system, which is one of the better rating and review entire track spec systems on the planet.

But it's behind the scenes. Right. Where it's behind the scenes and you can use Treadwell, but it's really behind the scenes.

Whereas for the agent. What I want to know from the agents is how much do you value or what do you value of that that for you needs to be brought to the front?

I'm kind of using ChatGPT and Atlas to tell me what they value and then how they would go about optimizing for this.

Right. So that's one way that I'm using Atlas. The other way I'm using Atlas is we do a lot of conversion rate optimization consulting.

And I've got two open asks right now at two companies who want to know how they can improve their conversion rates.

So I'm basically creating a GPT that for me is this is going to be my standard process for CRO.

I want that. I want this thing to go gather all the info to go look at the competition to take some inputs for me around where the day.

DataSits right now, and then to identify for me the places where there's a lot of juice for the squeeze so that I don't have to go do it, right?

And then I'm sitting, and then so basically I set up that GPT, and then Gaston and I were actually live working on this in Scottsdale.

And then the next one I said is, okay, now take all this information and turn it into a detailed document for me.

And the reason I want to turn it into a detailed document is because I want to make sure that the detailed document describes all the stuff that has to be done and all the stuff that has to be presented, right?

Now, the thing I'm working on today and tomorrow is, okay, now we're going to start sharpening these details and data, and I want to start creating the slides to drive the meeting, right?

So that's an example for me this week that's been very, very top of mind is those two kind of things.

Now, I'm going to, while these slides are being done, I'm co-kind of... I'm creating a template in beautiful AI so I can connect these things and so I can basically have it driven from there to here.

And then the goal would be I can use this to create 80% of a good, good conversion rate optimization conversation with prioritized areas and expected values.

And then the only thing I'm focusing on is turning the 30 slides into 10 for the executive summary. then eventually I'll get something to, you know, to get that further down the path.

Yeah. Um, I mean, that's, I'm here. My wife clamoring around in here. She's going listen to this while I was doing that on the side.

created a little agent to find stocking stuffers for her. I fed it in information about her, her likes or dislikes, what her business is like and the damn thing.

[@28:49](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1729.74) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's awesome. Yeah.

[@28:51](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1731.12) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

And I was doing that because I wanted to play and see how it operates and see how it actually functions.

It had much more difficulty doing that than it did buying tires. And I think it's because with tires, you can get down to just, I like that price.

I like that option. Can you throw those into a cart for me? And then all I have to do is the last mile, the credit card.

Whereas the example with her, since it's casting a wider net, there may be 93 different sites that it's coming up with ideas on.

And it was kind of struggling with, it can't just throw all that into one checkout process for you. So it was struggling a little bit, but that for me is how I'm trying to speed up the rote things we do in strategy, the routine things we do in strategy.

And I want to take things like, you know, client wants to justify a bigger media spend. Here's your process, right?

And here's your tools. Client wants a business case for... And client wants, you know, a weekly optimization plan, you know, client wants, so I want five or six, the five or six things we do repetitively in strategy.

I want to create this and then I want to load it into the Glue, the Glue corporate workspace and say, hey, here are the GPTs for this.

And then let people, you know, and then train people to use them and then let them hone them and perfect them.

Is that what you're looking for? That like that kind of thing? Yeah, that's fantastic.

[@30:29](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1829.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's, that's really, really good. And I guess the next question I have is, if you could have an AI expert sit with you for two hours and teach you one thing about AI with no one else watching, what would you want to learn?

[@30:45](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1845.26) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Oh, I would want to learn how, how, how the machine decides what is credible and valuable. And when it returns things that look alike, how does it decide that this one is what I present versus this one?

Because that would teach me how to talk to clients about the way they optimize. It's like, you know, for 20 years, there have been teams of people who have been, you know, who have been toiling away trying to, you know, trying to reverse engineer the algorithm for Google.

Right. And in that SEO world that, you know, they do that. the people that are good at it, like, they're valued.

Like, for me, it would be that. It would be, you know, it would really be that. And even if it was just one engine, mean, eventually we have to learn what ChatGPT likes versus what Claude likes versus what Grok likes, you know.

Yep, yep, yep, yep.

[@31:56](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1916.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But for me,

[@32:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1920.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

For this, I'd probably pick ChatGPT because I think Atlas is going to be pretty far ahead. I know Gemini is getting ahead on the shopping part a little bit, but I think Google is going to be very low to disrupt their paid ad platform so much right now.

But for me, it would be like ChatGPT, would be like, tell me when somebody's shopping for something, how Atlas decides that this versus this is in the initial result sets and gets presented.

Why did it like that? You know, why did it like this product on Walmart's page better than the same product on Amazon's page?

You know, like for me, that would be a fascinating thing to start to kind of unearth how this stuff works for our clients.

[@32:42](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1962.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's such a good answer, and it's an answer that I have not heard from anybody else. So you get a gold star on that one.

It's good. It's really good. What else? What am I going to ask you?

[@32:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=1974.38) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I mean, eventually I'd love to have an agent that will. We'll do a damn good job of telling me how to organize myself and making sure that I am advancing things.

But the most valuable thing for Glue for me right now would be something like that, because that's the hard thing.

If I had a number two, and I don't know if this is an actual correct answer for what you asked.

I'd pick something that gets repetitively produced at GlueIQ to help me understand how to have this produced by an engine and just merely reviewed.

I want the human to put inputs in, walk away, have it get produced, and then I want the human to review it and tweak it.

I don't want the human to make it, right? Because to me, you know, it's the old adage of AI is not going to take your job.

People who use AI are going to take your job. That's kind of the... I'd like to understand how someone who builds the engine sees the way to do that.

Like, what are the real pressure points to push on? And I'm hoping this is something that you're going to do for us, which is if Glue's got to start with three to five things and get the people to use engines to make those things, what are those things?

Yep.

[@34:32](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2072.64) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yep. What are those tools and what are those activities and deliverables? Yep.

[@34:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2077.7) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, like... 100%. Project plans. You know, like, here's one that drives me crazy. I don't have a screen at GlueIQ so that on Monday morning I can look at that says, here's the critical deliverables that GlueIQ has to make and deliver this week.

Like that doesn't exist.

[@35:04](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2104.94) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

How do you get to something like that?

[@35:07](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2107.64) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

And then how do I have the agent keep track of that and do the notifications, right? Tell somebody when they're behind, you know, or look at their calendar and add spaces to actually work.

Like, I don't know. There's a there there somehow.

[@35:25](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2125.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We just built an internal agentic built project management tool. That's pretty cool. So, and I feel you, it's like having something like that, where it's all visualized, where there's kind of a weekly, monthly, you know, annual or quarterly roadmap.

I mean, it's, it's very helpful, very helpful. Compared to other executives, you know, in similar roles, where would you honestly place your personal AI fluency?

Ahead, behind, or on par?

[@36:05](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2165.24) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Ooh. I'm certainly behind Gaston. But I also believe that that's probably going to be a perpetual state of truth, because he's just...

First of all, he needs some more hobbies in his life, but he's latched on to this, and he's really rabid.

I am probably ahead of... I'm probably on par with Matt and ahead of the other partners. If I look at my clients...

If I look at my clients probably ahead... mind. am at So And I think a lot of them use AI in their life to make it easier, but I think it's cursory AI.

see a lot of people talking to their phones like, chat GPT, tell me this.

[@37:12](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2232.88) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But I don't know that it ever gets past that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm doing the stocking stuffer thing that I just did kind of scenario.

[@37:20](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2240.94) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

No, that's good.

[@37:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2244.5) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The follow-up would be, what's the most sophisticated thing you've done with AI where the result truly impressed you?

[@37:48](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2268.0) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Wow, what a fantastic question. I think the thing that we just did Tuesday morning in Scottsdale, like, after a lot of work...

Just being able to sit down with a client and say, this is the way somebody's going to shop for your product in the future.

And I saw a variation in what got returned with the same script 30 minutes after I ran through with a test.

And I think the variation was improved. So I was very impressed that on the same script, the engine didn't go through exactly the same steps or process.

It seemed to self-replicate or self-improve, right? So you got a better output, yeah. I got a better output, and being able to sit there with a client and say, I ran through this with other people watching 30 minutes ago, and it did X, Y, and Z better this time.

All right. It was actually pretty impressive. I mean, there's little, I think there, other than that, there's little things that impress me.

think the fact that you can continue to prompt and hone in AI pretty quickly is actually awesome, right? I need to see AI produce polished things better, but I think, yeah, I think that impressed me.

The other place I would say that it's impressed me is I was doing some homework, just some research, and this is a general, I was impressed.

I was impressed at how much faster something like Atlas, ChatGPT, has made me at finding. The right nuggets of data, verifying that they're credible, and then stashing them away to use them.

And, you know, you know how hard research is, even with Google. I couldn't believe what's the trusted source, like, you know, how do you get the things, like, if there isn't an industry code, right, for this industry.

You almost could never get to the research, you had to cobble it together, but I've been impressed with ChatGPT's ability to actually, you know, say I need a subset of aftermarket auto parts, and I need you to hone in on that.

And that might mean you have to go to other places. And then lastly, what I've just been really impressed with is what it can absorb.

Now, I know, I know that the workspace is still working. on memory, but I've been pretty impressed with how much it can store and maintain.

[@41:10](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2470.76) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Those have been my big things.

[@41:12](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2472.68) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

mean, oh, in the stocking stuffer, the damn thing came back at some point and asked me what the size of the stocking was so that it can show something.

Wow.

[@41:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2484.44) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. That's fantastic. Yeah. That was a good one, too.

[@41:29](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2489.5) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Yeah.

[@41:33](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2493.82) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Next question is, Joey, you had to bet your job on one AI-driven innovation for GlueIQ, what would it be and why?

[@41:54](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2514.84) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Can I pick one client facing and one internal? Sure.

[@41:59](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2519.84) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Sure.

[@42:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2520.01) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

On the client-facing side, it would be the agentic commerce, and it would be like the thing that, you never heard this, but the thing that Stripe is about to do, where they're going to announce a partnership with Perplexity and ChatGPT and one other.

They are, Stripe is basically going to have an agentic marketplace, so if you load your product feeds into Stripe, people can complete the transaction inside of the agentic interface, and then Stripe just passes you the information to fulfill.

But think about it, it's like they're replicating what you can do with an Instagram storefront right now, or with a Shopify Plus inside of it, so they're going to have an MCP and an ACP.

I mean, like for me... The ability to understand and bet on agentic commerce, this is going to be on the scale of like the third-party marketplaces, like Walmart's marketplace and Amazon's marketplace.

So I would say that Glue has got to bet the farm there because it is going to be the newest commerce and marketing frontier.

Because I also know that when that starts happening, somebody's putting ads in that.

[@43:30](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2610.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And Stripe is doing amazing things. It's funny. So I needed to set up a new corporation. And I was looking at a few different registered agents, one of which I'd used.

And I said, there's got to be a faster, better way. So, of course, I'd just jump into Claude. This is what I'm trying to do.

It's a good way to do this. And it recommended this service that Stripe has called Stripe Atlas. this. to receptives.

So, broken we'll ant In Joey, set up a Delaware C-Corp in seven minutes. Seven minutes using their platform.

[@44:14](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2654.21) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

That's actually another interesting thing. My wife just started getting all kinds of messages about having to renew her copyright for her business.

Doing that, even with the ID.me stuff, it's a frigging nightmare. But if you want an attorney to do it, it's a minimum of $500 or $600.

So come to find out, she doesn't have to do it for another year, but another three or four months, I might just create an agent and say, here's what I need to go do.

And I bet it's going to get it done.

[@44:57](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2697.13) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. I think I think lawyers, especially people coming right out of law school, are pretty .

[@45:11](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2711.43) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

You have to wonder, like G had this whole thing the other day, and I'm not sure I believe him yet, because I don't know that the agent has the bedside manner or knows how to talk to people, but he was having a whole diatribe about how therapists might be really screwed.

[@45:30](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2730.58) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The number one use case of personal use for ChatGPT is therapists, as of Harvard's review in Q2 of this year.

Number one. Yeah. And I don't want to go down this rabbit hole because I've got a bunch more stuff to ask you, but the quick version is, it's $20 a month.

It's trained on the entire corpus of human psychology. You can ask. Ask for whatever type of therapist you want.

You know, do you want a therapist, you know, act as a family therapist, act as a child psychologist, act as a therapist with a specialty in, you know, midlife crisis trauma, like whatever it is.

And now you have your specialist. It's on demand. And there's no judgment. And so people aren't working. And that's the thing is that people will go in.

And, you know, I had a therapist many years ago when I was ending my first marriage, and she crossed a boundary with me, and I'll never forget it.

Like, she'd shared something with my wife's therapist and the whole thing, and it was just, like, one of those, like, what the moments.

[@46:48](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2808.86) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

And I think that front side, to your point, it's, like, setting HIPAA and, you know. backspace, hard as What may come with legal and structural guidelines, you think about therapy, think about fast-twitch legal advice, investment advice, there's no way you can't tell me that these engines, and I'm sure it's already getting used this way, right?

Isn't going to do a better job than a human of telling you how to move money around based on what trends are happening, right?

So yeah, I mean, that to me is going to be really, really fascinating, like stepping forward. The internal thing for Glue, so we can keep rolling.

I would say two things. Two parts of the same coin. One is, I would bet my job on figuring out how to produce analysis faster and better, actually really truly doing analysis, and the other would be creative production.

Right. So for me, it would be on the outside, it would be the big agentic commerce bet. And on the inside, it would be two core things that we do that we just need to do faster.

And we either need to be able to do more of it with the same number of humans, or we need to be able to do the same amount at a higher quality with less humans.

[@48:50](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2930.25) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Who are your top three AI fluent people in the organization? Not by title, but by actual capability. So, could be within the LT, the folks you just named, could be individual employees, top three AI fluent folks.

I mean, G's definitely probably at the top of the heap.

[@49:14](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=2954.95) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I'm not sure that anybody in the organization could challenge him right now in terms of breadth or scale. Let me think.

Sorry, I'm just doing a mental, like, run around. I would probably put Matt Kajawa in that, though I think different kinds of AI fluent.

I think G is AI advancement fluent and use case fluent. He both understands the landscape, and he is actually doing stuff at a much broader depth.

I think where Matt is excelling is really on the tools themselves and the use cases for the tools. So he's really getting into where is Figma going, and how are they thinking about this, and where is Builder going, and how are they thinking about this.

He's really getting into how AI is going to disrupt the traditional product and SI process.

[@50:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3037.57) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I think those two are certainly doing a good job of that.

[@50:40](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3040.93) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

When you get behind that, I don't know. I don't know. I don't, I don't know that I have an answer for a third.

I think there's probably, and I'm not going to say myself, I, I, I think you could probably say I'm there.

But I'm not going to answer that way. I don't know, I think you'd have a, you'd have a smaller group of four or five people that, that would be kind of challenging for the third to the seventh slot, so to speak.

I don't, I don't know of anyone that is walking through the door and using AI repetitively throughout the day to do their job better.

So that dovetails perfectly into the next question, which is what percentage of your people would you say are genuinely AI capable today?

the way we need them to be? Hello? One in five? 20%?

[@52:05](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3125.61) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@52:07](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3127.23) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I would guess maybe one in five people actually use some kind of AI tool each day to do something faster and more effectively.

[@52:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3139.03) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. I like the way you said that, too, because I think that is a really good rubric. Did you use it today to do something faster, better, and more effectively?

Looking out 18 months, what AI capabilities will your organization need that you definitely don't have today? Or put another way, what would Sam Altman or another tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit the gap?

[@52:53](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3173.53) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Oh. Without question. One, I would say workflow, some kind of workflow tool and some kind of output planning and output tracking.

And those are kind of two sides of the same coin, so to speak, right? 18 months from now, 100% of the things that we do repetitively must have a defined process, a defined tool to do them, even if the humans are using that tool.

And 100% of them, we should be able to noticeably know that it is faster and more effective to produce that output.

And I would argue it's not even 18 months. I candidly think that it's like a six-month thing. Yeah.

[@53:58](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3238.47) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I don't want be arguing with clients.

[@54:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3240.01) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I haven't seen any more about hours and allocations. I just want to be capable of overwhelming them with good stuff.

[@54:07](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3247.99) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

By the way, I was able to push my next meeting 15 minutes. So if you can go 15 more, we can keep rolling if that's okay.

[@54:15](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3255.73) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

It should be okay.

[@54:19](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3259.39) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

How are you currently measuring ROI on AI investments?

[@54:23](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3263.89) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Not. Not. I think we believe that the investment in beautiful AI has made it faster and more effective for us to produce decks and executive summaries and repetitive things, but I don't know that we've measured that.

And we struggle with the same thing that every SI or consultancy or agency has struggled. The effort always fills up the allocation.

So... You know, if we put a marker in the ground that said, look, if three months ago we had said on Discount Tire, here's the amount of energy and here's the hours, here's the raw hours we spend creating the deliverables every week.

If we had benchmarked that, I could look at it now and say, are we getting better at that? But I don't think we know those two answers.

I think we have to know those two answers. Sorry, I, we have to. I mean, don't like, can you ever really get down to how long it took you to make a banner or how long it took you to make an email or a landing page or how long it took you to make a strategy deck?

I don't know the answer to that, but I, I would say that we need to look at the hours we spend on clients where we have monthly.

recurring revenue, and it should take us less hours in the future, no matter what the discipline or domain is on this client, to actually keep them happy and produce what we need to produce.

That is a thing I think we could measure. Does that help? Yeah, that's great.

[@56:22](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3382.41) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I put this in the notes.

[@56:27](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3387.83) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

We have to prove that how many ever hours a month we spent on RBC or L-Car Wash or Discount Tire in 2025, we can produce more and better output in 2026 for less hours.

I think that we have to. Or none, yeah.

[@56:53](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3413.25) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Who is ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use in the organization? And how does Does that accountability work?

[@57:03](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3423.19) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Wow. Okay, let me think about. So how, trying to think about what would get us sued. The most problematic thing for us, I think, would be on the creative production side.

That generally has the highest likelihood of getting, you know, use infringement or patent trolls. I think it starts with, I think it starts with Noel and Gaston on the creative front to make sure that we can use AI effectively.

Especially generative AI to produce work, but also have a good process for vetting that that work meets the right use standards.

You know, because we can't get into an issue where we put something in the wild and then realize that somebody else owns that music, or we didn't license it, or somebody owns that image and we didn't license it.

So, like, to me, that's the place probably most desperately in need of something like that now. Right? I'm trying to think of another scenario.

Because this isn't like school. And it's not like getting a doctoral thesis. There's a high unlikelihood that you have some plagiaristic outcome that happens.

In our business, often you have to cite things because the client wants to know that they're from credible sources.

You don't get in trouble for, you don't get in trouble for like you're passing something of yours off and it's somebody else's.

That's not usually the challenge. Usually the challenge is, like I said, on those creative fronts. I'm trying to think of another scenario that really might be problematic for us.

I would be more worried about client information or Glue information being utilized in a non-private space. That's an interesting one.

I don't know that we have this person from being candid with you when you think about it that way.

Because we don't have a COO, and we don't have a privacy officer, and we don't have guidelines like that.

don't have guidelines that say, thou shalt never upload Discount Tire's marketing budget into Quad to get reactions to it.

Now, theoretically, all of the AI engines say that they never use your information, but Google used to say that too.

So I don't think that there is a person. I think there has to be a person.

[@1:00:35](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3635.17) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I would start on two fronts.

[@1:00:37](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3637.11) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I would start on the creative side with no LNG to define the process and what tools do we use for this, and then to make sure that the teams are trained that they have to do this.

And then I might have a producer on the backside of that process that's doing pre-live QA that's just vetting that everything is okay to use.

So how about that? Gaston Noel, to define the process for creative and the tool we use, a creative producer who is the last line of defense for checking and vetting the things.

And then I think we need some kind of internal governance for Glue and clients with pure information.

[@1:01:24](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3684.53) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's good. I like it. What AI tool or initiative did your organization invest in but ultimately abandon what happened and what did you learn?

[@1:01:53](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3713.09) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I don't know that I would call it an AI tool, though I think they may argue. That, I'm trying to, blanking on the system that we used before we moved to Productive.

Before we moved to Productive, we had another agency management software that I just don't, I think we've had a couple of instances between that, and I'm going to remember the name of it, and like HubSpot, where I'm sitting here renewing all of our HubSpot licenses in use right now.

And in both those instances, I don't think the tool was at fault. I think we were at fault because we didn't actually utilize the really promising things in the tool well.

We almost acted like, because it could do all these things, that it would just... We do those things. And I also think in any instance where a tool fails, it's because there is no expectation of the way it gets used.

Right? So if we decide to abandon HubSpot, because it's not doing what we want from a contact tracking, from a BD perspective, etc., that has to go somewhere.

Yeah. We have the same issues wherever it goes, unless it's, you know, whatever, it's my if we don't produce the reports and follow up on the things and people don't input the stuff correctly.

So I would say we have a couple of instances where we have started and stopped. I also think we have a tool called Motion that we're supposed to be using for creative variation and for testing and things like that.

And I, I'm not sure that we're actually really using it. Yeah.

[@1:03:59](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3839.45) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Well, I think we have it, and because we have it, we think people use it, but I don't know that we're really using it.

So let's... You'll fail, too. No, no, no, that's really good context. I'm going to do one more question, and then if we could grab some time next week, that would be fantastic, and we can wrap this up, if that's okay.

Okay. You've given some really great answers, and we've gone deeper, which I love, and I really appreciate, and there's a lot of value in what you've shared, Joey, so thank you.

[@1:04:41](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3881.05) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

You've been generous, really generous.

[@1:04:45](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3885.79) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you give me a specific example where AI dramatically changed your delivery timeline? What was possible that wasn't before?

Oh, I...

[@1:05:00](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3900.01) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I, because of a combination of writer's block and another client having a major issue, I was forced to create the decklet and the presentation for Tuesday morning, functionally Monday while I was flying.

And if I didn't have Atlas and Beautiful AI, I'm not sure I wouldn't have gotten it done. I would have gotten it done.

It just wouldn't have been nearly as effective. Yeah. A very recent kind of thing there. Unfortunately, I find myself going back to kind of the core tools.

It's still at this point in time, it's BOD or it's ChatGPT or the new Atlas browser that will do most of the lifting helping me get these things done right now.

So I am working inside of the Atlas workspaces to actually, like I said, create common GPTs so that people can run agents, but we're not quite there yet.

But I think we're going to get better, but it goes back to having the three or five things and then just saying here, but that's my example from this week.

[@1:06:22](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=3982.55) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's great. Struggled. How does, let's just take a quick look at next week. What's good for you to grab just a little more time?

Maybe grab another 30 minutes. may not take us that long, but just 30 minutes would be great.

[@1:06:40](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4000.69) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

I'm going to look right now. Just let me let this thing pop up, flip over. Um, da-dum-dum-dum. I'm, I'm pretty good.

**ACTION ITEM: Send calendar invite to Joey for Dec 15 11:00 follow-up (30 min) \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4016.9999)**

Um, anything between like. Like, 11 to 1 Monday, I'm wide open. Let's do 11 a.m.

[@1:07:09](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4029.43) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Monday. Great.

[@1:07:11](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4031.01) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

Let's do it. right. Fantastic.

[@1:07:13](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4033.39) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

All right. I will send that over momentarily. And I will see you on Monday. And thank you, man. It's great to see you, dude.

And, you know, really just so appreciate how thoughtful your answers are. And it's great. It validates a lot of the things that I've already heard.

But you've also added some really interesting nuance that is important. And as one of the, even though you don't consider yourself among the three AI wise men, I think you definitely are one.

I think that I am catching up quickly.

[@1:07:58](https://fathom.video/share/HoXSwNfpwu_Zp3cLutmzVTXUpzNhPA-h?timestamp=4078.15) \- **JW (GlueIQ)**

It's just, it's what's going to be really. Really interesting, when you come back with recommendations, it's going to be very, very important that we as partners explain to people, here's the recommendations we got, we are going to do those things.

You have no choice. Not only will you not get in the way of this, but you will adopt and use it or you have no place here.

And I think that's the thing that we really need to transition to rapidly. know you can't rush the process, but I'm very excited to see the very kind of tactical, detailed recommendations of what to go do.

Because I think that's just, we have to, we have no choice. Nope. Well, hey, have a great weekend if I don't talk to you.

It was great seeing and talking to you again, and I look forward to some more Monday.
