   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
     ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open http://localhost:3000**

## Architecture

### MCP Integration
The app uses the Model Context Protocol to communicate with multiple AI providers:

- `/lib/mcp/` - MCP server implementation and providers
- `/app/api/chat/` - Next.js API route for handling chat requests
- Model selection UI in the chat interface

### Chat Flow
1. Initial greeting uses local chat flow (no API calls)
2. After user provides basic info, switches to selected AI model
3. UI dynamically transforms based on conversation stage

### Key Components
- `ChatInterface` - Main chat component with model selection
- `ModelSelector` - Dropdown for choosing AI models
- `DynamicBackground` - Animated background that responds to chat state
- `MessageBubble` - Individual message display with animations

## Available Models
