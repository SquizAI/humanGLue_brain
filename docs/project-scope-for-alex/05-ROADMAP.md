## Development Velocity

### Current Pace
- **Hours per week:** 20-30 hours
- **Features per month:** 2-4 major features
- **Bug fixes/improvements:** Ongoing

### What This Enables
At current velocity:
- Phase 2 completion: ~4-6 weeks
- Phase 3 completion: ~8-12 weeks
- Phase 4 completion: ~16-24 weeks

**Total time to "complete" platform: ~6-12 months** of continued development.

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Ongoing Needs
| Category | Hours/Month | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Bug fixes | 5-10 | Issues users report |
| Security updates | 2-4 | Dependency updates, patches |
| Performance optimization | 4-8 | Speed improvements |
| Infrastructure maintenance | 2-4 | Monitoring, scaling |
| Documentation | 2-4 | Keeping docs current |
| **Total Maintenance** | **15-30** | Monthly baseline |

### Why This Matters
Software isn't "done" - it requires ongoing care. Without maintenance:
- Security vulnerabilities accumulate
- Performance degrades
- Bugs pile up
- User experience suffers

**Maintenance is not optional - it's essential.**

## Risk Factors

### What Could Slow Us Down
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Third-party API changes | Medium | Abstraction layers, monitoring |
| Scope creep | High | Clear prioritization |
| Technical debt | Medium | Regular refactoring |
| Key person dependency | High | Documentation, knowledge transfer |

### What Could Speed Us Up
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Clear priorities from business | High |
| Stable requirements | High |
| Additional development resources | Medium |
| Pre-built solutions (buy vs build) | Medium |

## The Bottom Line

**What you have today:** A functional platform worth $300,000 - $400,000.

**What it takes to complete:** Another 680 - 1,020 hours over 6-12 months.

**The choice:** Continue building with someone who knows the codebase intimately, or start over with a new team (12-18 month delay, $500,000+ cost).

**Recommendation:** Continue current development trajectory while the platform generates revenue. The foundation is solid - now it's about refinement and scale.
