# Human Glue Technology Investment Roadmap
**June 2025**

## Executive Summary

This technology investment roadmap outlines the strategic technology initiatives required to support Human Glue's expanded service offerings and drive profitable growth. The roadmap covers a 24-month horizon (July 2025 - June 2027) and details the AI technologies, platform development, integration capabilities, and data infrastructure needed to deliver our new services at scale.

The roadmap is designed to be implemented in three phases, with clear milestones, resource requirements, and expected business outcomes for each phase. Total investment over the 24-month period is estimated at $8.2 million, with an expected ROI of 285% over a five-year period based on increased service delivery capabilities, operational efficiencies, and competitive differentiation.

## Strategic Context

Human Glue's business strategy calls for expanding our service offerings in five key areas:

1. AI-Powered Workforce Transformation Services
2. Skills-Based Organizational Design
3. Workforce Analytics and Intelligence Platform
4. Digital Learning Experience Design
5. Organizational Change Enablement for AI Integration

To successfully deliver these services and achieve our profitability targets, we need to make strategic investments in our technology capabilities. These investments will enable us to:

- Develop proprietary platforms and tools that differentiate our offerings
- Leverage cutting-edge AI technologies to deliver superior client outcomes
- Scale our service delivery capabilities while maintaining quality
- Create data-driven insights that demonstrate measurable client value
- Build a technology foundation that supports ongoing innovation

## Current Technology Landscape

Our current technology stack has several limitations that must be addressed:

- **Limited AI capabilities**: Our existing tools lack advanced AI features such as natural language processing, machine learning, and predictive analytics
- **Fragmented data architecture**: Client data is stored across multiple systems without a unified data model
- **Manual processes**: Many key processes rely on manual effort, limiting scalability
- **Integration challenges**: Limited ability to integrate with client systems and third-party tools
- **Reporting limitations**: Basic reporting capabilities that don't provide real-time insights or predictive analytics

## Technology Investment Priorities

Based on our strategic objectives and current limitations, we have identified six key investment priorities:

### 1. AI and Machine Learning Foundation

Investment in core AI technologies to power our service offerings:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Implementation of enterprise-grade LLMs for natural language processing, content generation, and conversational interfaces
- **Machine Learning Platform**: Development of a scalable ML platform for predictive analytics, skills matching, and personalized recommendations
- **Computer Vision**: Capabilities for analyzing visual content in learning materials and organizational documentation
- **Agentic AI Framework**: Infrastructure for developing autonomous AI agents that can perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention

According to the World Economic Forum (2025), agentic AI is transforming workforce development by enabling autonomous systems that can plan and execute tasks independently, making it a critical capability for our service offerings.

### 2. Skills Intelligence Platform

Development of our proprietary Skills Intelligence Platform:

- **Skills Taxonomy Engine**: AI-powered system for creating and maintaining custom skills taxonomies
- **Skills Assessment Tools**: Capabilities for evaluating individual and organizational skills through various methods
- **Skills Gap Analysis**: Algorithms for identifying critical skills gaps at individual, team, and organizational levels
- **Predictive Skills Modeling**: Advanced analytics for forecasting future skill requirements

Research from McKinsey (2025) indicates that organizations with sophisticated skills intelligence capabilities are 2.3x more likely to successfully navigate workforce transitions and 1.8x more likely to outperform industry peers in productivity.

### 3. Learning Experience Platform

Creation of a next-generation learning platform:

- **Adaptive Learning Engine**: AI-driven system that personalizes learning pathways based on individual needs and preferences
- **Content Generation Tools**: Capabilities for creating and curating learning content across multiple modalities
- **Learning Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking and analysis of learning activities and outcomes
- **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality Integration**: Support for immersive learning experiences

According to DataSociety (2025), the most significant training trend in 2025 is using AI to customize training at both organizational and individual levels, with hyper-personalization becoming the standard expectation.

### 4. Talent Marketplace

Development of an AI-powered internal talent marketplace:

- **Skills-Based Matching Engine**: Algorithms for matching employees to opportunities based on skills and preferences
- **Career Pathing Tools**: Interactive tools for visualizing and planning career trajectories
- **Opportunity Recommendation System**: AI-driven recommendations for projects, roles, and learning opportunities
- **Talent Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting on talent mobility and utilization

Research from Deloitte (2025) shows that organizations with advanced talent marketplaces achieve 32% higher employee engagement and 27% lower attrition compared to those without such capabilities.

### 5. Data Integration and Analytics

Building a robust data foundation:

- **Data Lake Architecture**: Scalable storage for structured and unstructured data
- **API Integration Framework**: Standardized approach for connecting with client systems and third-party tools
- **Data Governance Framework**: Policies and procedures for ensuring data quality and security
- **Advanced Analytics Engine**: Tools for generating actionable insights from complex datasets

Gartner (2025) predicts that by 2027, organizations with integrated workforce data platforms will realize 40% greater value from their HR technology investments compared to those with fragmented approaches.

### 6. Security and Compliance Infrastructure
