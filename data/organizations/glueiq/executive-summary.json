  "executiveSummary": "Based on analysis of 9 C-suite interviews totaling over 10 hours of conversation, GlueIQ demonstrates emerging AI adoption with significant gaps between leadership aspiration and operational reality. The organization has strong leadership vision (6.5/10) but critically weak AI governance (1.5/10) and strategy alignment (2.5/10). Key themes include: no formal AI transformation plan, no ROI measurement, no ethics governance owner, and a creative team that leads adoption while account/PM teams lag significantly. Identified AI champions (Gaston, Matt K., Casey, Noel, Joey) can serve as change agents. Overall AI maturity score: 3.8/10 (Level 3: Interested). Immediate priorities should focus on formalizing AI strategy, establishing governance, and targeted upskilling.",
