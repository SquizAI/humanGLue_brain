# 🎓 Skills & Capabilities Assessment

Evaluating if your workforce is ready to work with AI or needs serious upskilling

## 1. Current Skills Inventory: Stone Age, Digital Age, or AI Age?

### What it measures:

- **Effectiveness**: 10% skill retention

**INDUSTRIAL AGE LEARNING (Structured)**
- Scheduled classroom training
- Some online courses
- Department budgets exist
- Basic tracking present
- Example: "Everyone takes the BI course"
- **Effectiveness**: 30% skill retention

**DIGITAL AGE LEARNING (Blended)**
- Mix of formats available
- Personalized paths emerging
- Continuous learning encouraged
- Skills tracking mature
- Example: "We have LinkedIn Learning for all"
- **Effectiveness**: 50% skill retention

**AI AGE LEARNING (Adaptive)**
- AI-powered recommendations
- Just-in-time micro-learning
- Peer learning networks
- Real-time skill assessment
- Example: "Our AI suggests what to learn next"
- **Effectiveness**: 70% skill retention

#### Learning Culture Indicators:
- Learning time protected?
- Failure celebrated as learning?
- Knowledge sharing rewarded?
- Continuous improvement mindset?
