## Objection Handling Guide

### "We're not ready for AI yet"
**Response:** "That's exactly why an assessment is valuable. It shows you exactly where you are today and provides a roadmap for when you are ready. Plus, your clients are already asking about AI—wouldn't you rather lead than follow?"

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:** "Let's look at the ROI. If just one client chooses you over a competitor because of your AI capabilities, you've paid for the assessment. Our data shows agencies typically see 5-10x ROI within 12 months."

### "We don't have time for this now"
**Response:** "The assessment takes just 15 minutes of executive time. The insights could save you months of trial and error. Plus, we've seen agencies lose clients to AI-ready competitors—can you afford not to make time?"

### "How do we know this works?"
**Response:** "Great question. Let's look at [specific case study similar to GlueIQ]. They saw [specific results]. Plus, we offer a satisfaction guarantee—if the assessment doesn't provide value, we'll refund your investment."

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:** "Of course. What specific concerns can I address to help you make the best decision? Also, I should mention our Q1 calendar is filling up, and we can only onboard 5 agencies this quarter. When would you need to start seeing results?"
