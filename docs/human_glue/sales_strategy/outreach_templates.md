### CHRO Outreach Sequence

#### Initial Email to Sarah Martinez, CHRO

**Subject:** Organizational Integration at Innovatech + DataSync

```
Hi Sarah,

Congratulations on your recent appointment as CHRO at Innovatech Solutions. I've been following your insights on scaling people operations during hypergrowth since your time at Workday, and your recent podcast on the topic resonated with our work at Human Glue.

I noticed Innovatech recently acquired DataSync Technologies, and I imagine you're navigating the cultural and organizational integration challenges that come with bringing together two distinct teams. In our work with similar tech companies undergoing acquisition integration, we've found that the first 6 months are critical for establishing organizational alignment while maintaining the innovative culture that drives growth.

We've developed an approach that combines AI-powered organizational assessment with practical implementation support, helping companies like [Similar Company] reduce post-acquisition turnover by 35% while accelerating integration timelines by nearly 3 months.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how we're helping technology companies navigate post-acquisition integration while scaling their leadership capabilities? I'd be happy to share some specific insights relevant to Innovatech's situation.

Best regards,

#### Follow-up Email #1 (Day 3)

**Subject:** Research on Post-Acquisition Integration Success Factors

```
Hi Sarah,

I wanted to follow up on my previous message and share some research we've compiled on the critical success factors for post-acquisition integration in high-growth technology companies.

The attached one-pager highlights the three organizational factors most predictive of successful integration:
1. Leadership alignment across both organizations
2. Consistent communication of strategic rationale
3. Early identification of cultural integration barriers

Given Innovatech's recent acquisition of DataSync and your "OneInnovatech" initiative, I thought this might be particularly relevant to your current priorities.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how our organizational assessment approach has helped companies like yours identify these factors early in the integration process, leading to more successful outcomes.

Would your calendar allow for a brief 20-minute conversation next week?

#### Follow-up Email #2 (Day 7)

**Subject:** How [Similar Company] Accelerated Their Integration Process

```
Hi Sarah,

I hope your week is going well. I wanted to share a brief case study of how [Similar Company], another high-growth technology company that recently went through an acquisition, used our organizational health assessment to accelerate their integration process.

Their CHRO faced similar challenges to what Innovatech might be experiencing:
- Bringing together different organizational cultures
- Maintaining engagement during the transition
- Ensuring leadership alignment across the expanded organization

Using our approach, they were able to:
- Identify specific integration barriers within 2 weeks
- Implement targeted interventions based on data-driven insights
- Reduce post-acquisition turnover by 35% compared to industry averages
- Achieve full cultural integration 3 months ahead of their initial timeline

I'd be happy to connect you with their CHRO to discuss their experience directly, or we could arrange a brief call to explore how a similar approach might benefit Innovatech during this critical integration period.

#### Final Follow-up (Day 14)

**Subject:** Quick question about Innovatech's leadership development program

```
Hi Sarah,

I noticed in Innovatech's recent investor presentation that developing leadership capabilities across your expanded organization is a strategic priority this year.

This caught my attention because we've developed a unique approach that combines AI-powered assessment with practical leadership development tools specifically designed for high-growth technology companies with distributed teams.

Rather than traditional leadership training, our approach focuses on:
1. Identifying specific organizational contexts where leadership effectiveness is most critical
2. Providing targeted development based on actual organizational needs
3. Measuring leadership impact on team performance and engagement

Given your background in HR transformation, I thought you might be interested in how this data-driven approach is helping companies like Innovatech develop leaders who can thrive in rapidly scaling environments.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about this approach and how it might complement your leadership development initiatives?

### Director of Organizational Development Outreach

#### Initial Email to Michael Rodriguez, Director of OD

**Subject:** Leadership Development in Matrix Organizations

```
Hi Michael,

I've been following your thoughtful comments on organizational development topics on LinkedIn, particularly your recent insights on developing leaders in complex matrix structures. Your perspective aligns closely with our research at Human Glue on leadership effectiveness in high-growth technology companies.

I noticed you're currently designing a leadership development program for mid-level managers at Innovatech. Given your background at McKinsey's Organization Practice, I imagine you're taking a data-driven approach to identifying development priorities.

We've developed an organizational assessment methodology that helps companies like Innovatech identify specific leadership capabilities that drive team performance in matrix organizations. Our approach combines AI-powered analysis with practical implementation support, helping companies develop targeted interventions rather than generic leadership programs.

Would you be interested in discussing how this approach might provide additional insights for your leadership development initiative? I'd be happy to share some specific examples relevant to Innovatech's context.

### VP of Engineering Outreach

#### Initial Email to Thomas Greene, VP of Engineering

**Subject:** Engineering Leadership at Scale - Lessons from Similar Organizations

```
Hi Thomas,

I read your recent LinkedIn post about the challenges of "engineering leadership at scale" and was impressed by your insights on maintaining innovation culture during rapid growth. Your perspective resonates with what we're seeing across high-growth technology companies.

At Human Glue, we work with engineering leaders facing similar challenges to those you described - balancing process standardization with innovation, maintaining team cohesion in distributed environments, and developing new engineering managers rapidly.

One approach that's been particularly effective is using organizational network analysis to identify collaboration patterns and potential silos before they impact delivery. For example, we helped [Similar Engineering Organization] improve cross-team collaboration by 40% while reducing coordination overhead by identifying specific organizational friction points.

Given Innovatech's recent acquisition and expansion, I thought you might be interested in how this data-driven approach could help maintain engineering effectiveness during this period of growth.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how we're helping engineering leaders navigate similar challenges?

Best regards,

#### Follow-up Email (Day 5)

**Subject:** Engineering Culture Integration - DataSync + Innovatech

```
Hi Thomas,

I wanted to follow up on my previous message with some specific insights about engineering culture integration following acquisitions.

In our work with technology companies, we've found that engineering teams often face unique challenges during integration:

1. Reconciling different development methodologies and practices
2. Maintaining velocity while integrating teams and codebases
3. Preserving the innovative elements of both engineering cultures
4. Developing a unified technical vision across the expanded organization

We've developed an assessment approach specifically for engineering organizations that helps identify these challenges early and develop targeted interventions.

I'd be happy to share a case study of how [Similar Company] used this approach during their recent acquisition to maintain engineering productivity throughout the integration process.

Would you be interested in a brief conversation about how this might apply to Innovatech's integration with DataSync?
