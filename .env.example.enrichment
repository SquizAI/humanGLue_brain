# Phase 0.3: Data Enrichment API Keys (Optional)
# 
# These API keys enhance the company enrichment feature.
# The system works without them using fallback domain parsing.
#
# Get your keys:
# - Clearbit: https://dashboard.clearbit.com/
# - Hunter.io: https://hunter.io/api

# Clearbit API (Recommended for best results)
# Provides: company name, industry, employee count, and more
CLEARBIT_API_KEY=

# Hunter.io API (Alternative or backup)
# Provides: company name, industry
HUNTER_API_KEY=

# Note: Without API keys, the system will:
# - Extract company name from domain (e.g., "microsoft.com" → "Microsoft")
# - Return basic fallback data
# - Still provide a good user experience
