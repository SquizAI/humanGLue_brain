# R² (Relative Reality) and Second Brain Integration

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive analysis, mapping, and implementation roadmap for integrating the Relative Reality (R²) framework with LVNG's Second Brain architecture. The goal is to create an enterprise-ready AI system that combines theoretical advances in AI consciousness with practical business applications.
