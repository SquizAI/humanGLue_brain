[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=0.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Good week so far. Good Thanksgiving.

[@0:05](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=5.2) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

We are busy.

[@0:08](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=8.22) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

A lot going on.

[@0:09](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=9.5) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

You would think it would slow down during the holidays, but it like amped up to like five times five.

[@0:15](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=15.24) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So I spend their money. Yeah. I'm not sure if you're aware. I used to work with Gaston at Sapient.

[@0:25](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=25.1) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Oh, cool. Yeah, we all worked with each other, man, at some given point at Sapient.

[@0:31](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=31.46) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, your name's familiar. Were you working out of Miami?

[@0:38](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=38.24) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I did multiple stints. I was part of actually Gaston's team before it was even Sapient. I was part of a planning group.

Oh, wow. Your legacy PGI, huh? Yeah, yeah. And then I came back after a little time in New York and was part of the South Beach office.

So I was there from, holy , now I'm trying to remember. I remember what era it was, but yeah, my last stint at Sapien was in the South Beach days, so in the 605 building.

[@1:07](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=67.26) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So you used to work with my boy Kevin McGovern on Lincoln Road, I'm guessing.

[@1:11](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=71.58) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

On Lincoln Road, yeah.

[@1:13](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=73.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, yeah, very cool, very cool. Well, listen, in respect of the busyness, in respect of your time, we can dive right in.

There's about 26 questions that we're going to be going through, so just to give you a heads up. And this is the pilot of the Human Glue, my company's reality gap assessment.

So we're doing this with GlueIQ. We're looking for opportunities to not only help you guys with your AI and upskilling transformation, but also figure out how perhaps we can go to market together on some of these things.

[@1:51](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=111.56) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

So it could be really exciting.

[@1:53](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=113.7) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So this is the GlueIQ. Transformation Model, G-L-U-E. G stands for GROW, Individual Skill Building and Confidence Development, Leverage, AI Tool Mastery and Value Creation, Unite, Social Learning and Organizational Change.

How do we do that together? And Evolve, which is Ongoing Development and Thought Leadership. And so I'm doing a full interview across the LT, and then I'll also be interviewing about 50 individual employees after this.

[@2:28](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=148.02) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Okay.

[@2:31](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=151.32) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So the focus is to help us understand where GlueIQ sits on this Glue transformation journey from individual growth to tool-leverage to organizational unity and strategic evolution.

And I'm really interested in your candid perspective on what's working and what's not and where you see gaps. There's no wrong answers.

The value comes from comparing leadership and employee perspectives to unearth. opportunities. And a very important point is everything we discuss, noel, is confidential.

It'll be aggregated to create insight, not evaluate individuals. So all be anonymized. Okay. So first question, before we dive into AI specifically, can you tell me a time when GlueIQ successfully rolled out a new transformation initiative?

Doesn't have to be technology, just a transformation initiative in general. And what made that adoption work? Yeah.

[@3:38](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=218.68) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

mean, so we do have a hybrid model. So, I mean, I've seen it on a couple of fronts. On the more traditional kind of like marketing side of the house, we've been using it.

We've been using AI a lot. I mean, it's pretty much a daily part of our workflow. Everything from strategy and

Insight gathering to even like image manipulation and just, you know, content generation. It's become a big part of our workflow.

So as far, to answer your question, as far as like where I've seen it do good in transformation, you know, as recently we've been using it to help, you know, like a client redesign a brand, right?

So like very tactically, that's one example. You know, we've done it for like Azamara. The AAP, we've been using it for that.

So on every level from, you know, even, you know, doing a full-on brand redevelopment, it's used in every touchpoint really, I mean, at this point.

Then on the consultant side of the house, I haven't really delved deep into it, but one of the early projects that I was freelancing on and then kind of was at the tail end.

And so I've seen two that are interesting. So we did one where... For DirecTV, had to do what they called a growth pod.

So essentially, it was like a rapid ideation, rapid strategy, rapid brief kind of initiative. So instead of it being a long tail, you got two months to come up with a campaign and put it in market and test.

Literally, this was like a week or two. So super compressed, and AI was a big part of that workflow.

So and as far as an output from that, I think the results were like 13x, like an increased performance times, you know, whatever their baseline media ads.

So we had to do like social media, like concepts for them. And I think the results were like 13x increase in conversion.

And so it was really, really effective.

[@5:54](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=354.14) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So Noel, that is a fantastic example, but I'm really talking more. Or about internally, the internal adoption, what did you see?

Oh, internal adoption.

[@6:05](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=365.7) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I mean, everybody's been pretty open to it. It's funny. I'm sorry if I didn't understand your question.

[@6:14](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=374.08) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, it's my fault for not being clear.

[@6:16](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=376.16) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I mean, I've seen as far as internal adoption from the creative team, I would say 75% of people are already on it, already using it, and are super open and are very hungry to see what's next.

And are sharing it actively with a larger group to catch them up. And there isn't any kind of hiding it and keeping secret tools.

None of that. Everybody's pretty open with it. You'll have maybe 25% of the people that are maybe a little skeptical, but are starting to come around and are starting to actively use it.

So yeah, I mean, I've seen some pretty good adoption overall. Fantastic.

[@6:56](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=416.72) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

From the creative team.

[@6:57](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=417.8) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

From the others, I haven't seen as much. Much meaning account. Strategy definitely is pretty much on it. But yeah, I've seen less from account and less from program management or project management, if that makes sense.

[@7:14](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=434.12) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's talk about you personally. What AI tools did you use yesterday, this week, or this week in your actual work?

Using a little bit of everything, man.

[@7:28](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=448.08) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

From Gemini to MidJourney, GPT pretty much is a staple. And I know those are my three kind of go-to.

And then, you know, all the tools, the Adobe tools pretty much have it already integrated. So it's literally every single day usage.

[@7:49](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=469.88) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And what would you say is the most sophisticated thing you've done with AI recently or in the last couple months that actually surprised you in terms of the research?

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=480.58) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Gemini has been pretty good, man. At first, it was a little wonky, but some of the stuff that's been coming out of the Gemini Pro, we were working on some rips to get some work sold, and what the team was able to do in a day was pretty incredible.

I mean, full-on audio, it's a combination of stuff like Sora, and I think they were using definitely Gemini for image generation, and there was another Google Wave or something like that.

I don't know, there's another video product that they were using from the G Suite stuff, or the Gemini stuff, and that was pretty cool.

Yeah, I mean, I haven't really used anything new that I would say is like, wow, that was mind-blowing. I've just seen iterative improvements in image generation.

Things are starting to get smaller, I mean, smarter and slower, surprisingly. Like, ChatGBT has just gotten freaking slow. I guess this new model, V5 or whatever, is smarter, but not really.

It's lost a little bit of the human kind of flavor. So I actually have gone back to the older model for certain things.

But for research stuff, you know, the team has actually been using Gemini. I haven't really used it for that.

I've been just pretty much doing GPT for just like, you know, mining insights and, you know, looking for strategy resources and stuff like that.

But, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. But to answer your question, nothing mind-blowing yet. I'm sure they'll change in a week.

[@9:37](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=577.221) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Well, it sounds like a lot of mind-blowing things, actually. It does. It does. If you could sit with an AI expert for two hours and teach you one thing about AI with no one else watching, what would you want to learn?

[@9:53](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=593.521) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

How to make a million bucks and not have to work anymore, to be honest.

[@9:59](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=599.161) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

How to to to to to

[@10:01](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=601.041) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I mean, honestly, it would probably be some type of entrepreneurial thing or invent some . Funny enough, I have a good friend of mine that just started, he started his own little AI component thing for video production.

It would probably be to start some digital tool for myself. Very cool.

[@10:21](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=621.081) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, so AI product innovation, AI tool innovation.

[@10:24](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=624.741) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. Sweet. I have it self-coded, you know, the whole thing.

[@10:31](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=631.921) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Let's see. Can you tell me about a time when AI challenged your assumptions and what you learned from that experience?

[@10:42](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=642.701) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Challenged my assumptions as in like?

[@10:45](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=645.181) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Could be around a business problem, could be around a workflow, could be around maybe, you know, what you thought was or wasn't possible with AI.

Just challenged your assumptions in some way.

[@11:01](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=661.081) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I think I challenge my AI bots and agents all the time. I don't take what they give me as Bible, if that makes sense.

So I'm constantly challenging and poking, prodding all of the information that it gives me, fact-checking, you know, having it pull sources so I can read the sources and see if the assumptions that it gave me were the correct ones.

You know, just, I'm always very hypercritical and I'm actually kind of mean to it. That's good.

[@11:33](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=693.661) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, I do the same thing. Yeah, I do. I'll say, you know, you missed the point, do it again.

Or it's interesting sometimes when you prompt and you probably do this, but you say, you know, do that again and really impress me.

[@11:51](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=711.081) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. And sometimes you'll get really good results from that.

[@11:54](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=714.481) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's like, okay, okay.

[@11:56](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=716.861) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. I'm constantly having to like creative directing. And refocus it, and it's like, what the hell are you doing?

Like, you completely, like, didn't answer what I was asking you. So, yeah, it's an everyday thing. I will tell you that some of the agents have gotten a little smarter.

You know, I guess the more that you use it and it starts to learn your thinking style, and they tend to get a little better, especially if you program it with the type of processes that you wanted to kind of do.

It's gotten better, but yeah, it's a constant thing, yes. It's realigning it and, you know, challenging its sources, and yeah, hopefully that answered your question.

[@12:36](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=756.341) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, it's good. It did. What I'm hearing is you challenge it more than you feel like it challenges you in some ways, which is cool.

[@12:44](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=764.201) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[@12:47](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=767.221) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And we didn't land on the specificity of your exact role.

[@12:53](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=773.301) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Could you share a little bit more about what was... I'm chief creative officer, so I'm pretty much overseeing, you know, a creative...

of activities across Fali accounts.

[@13:02](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=782.161) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Very cool. Okay, awesome. And this is a personal kind of AI fluency question. So compared to other executives, chief creative officers, you know, in similar roles, where would you place your personal AI fluency?

Ahead, behind, or on par in the middle?

[@13:24](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=804.981) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I would say ahead because I came from consulting before coming here. And we were doing AI before it was mainstream.

So I've been pretty much, you know, in the very early, early steps of it, you know, and I've kind of seen it flourish.

I wish I had more time to be a little more fluent in it, you know, and just, it's just chasing so damn fast, but I would say I'm advanced.

I mean, I'm using it day to day from pretty much what everybody's typically using it now, but I'm always looking for a hack.

I am always looking for, I mean, I'm connected... ... To people who are using it in different ways that I think creatives don't think, because again, come from consulting, so just in my own LinkedIn feed, like the way that people are using it, so to give you an example, one, and it's funny enough, so we have, we have like these creative monthlies every month, and we present like, you know, what's out there, a trend, ways for people to kind of use creativity in a new way.

AI is a big part of what we talk about, just new tools and things that people are using in the agency, and one of them was talking about Gemini, and the Gemini Pro in specific, and how advanced that's gotten, right, and how smart it's gotten, and he was saying that, you know, people are starting to do visual dashboards and stuff like that, and interestingly enough, I brought up the fact that some of the consultants that I work with, and again, creatives don't really think this way, they're using it more for like, image manipulation, know, storytelling, that kind of stuff, like the typical stuff that is in route with what

What they're, you know, supposed to be delivering or whatever, or maybe creating a, you know, a new business idea or whatever, you know, just the more entrepreneurial ones.

But what was interesting is like from the consulting side of my feed, right, people are looking for new ways to talk with executives, right?

Because that's like at the end of the day, that's what consultants do, right? They're like, they're pretty much in relationships with a CTO or a CMO of some sort or some type of C-level, and they have no patience.

They have very short attention spans. They want the bottom line up front. So they're always looking for ways to turn a 50, 60-page deck or 100-page deck into a one-sheeter or a two-sheeter.

So a lot of the things that I've been seeing actually people do is they're starting to do these visual dashboards that are like literally just like visual KPIs with infographics and throttle marks and the whole thing to show like, you know, the story of a strategy coming to life and to fruition.

Looking at almost like a placemat. So that was one thing that I saw that was trending, and it was interesting.

So I'm trying to bring that up to the team, too, just to think differently. We're starting to even do workshops and stuff like that, which isn't a typical thing for creatives to do.

So again, I'm always looking for another angle of how to use the tool in a new and unexpected way that solves for the business, but also for the creative part, if that makes sense.

That's a fantastic answer, man.

[@16:28](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=988.741) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That was a long-winded answer. No, that's a great answer. It gives me a lot of context, and you made a lot of really sharp and insightful points about what you're seeing happening in the industry and what people are looking for.

So that's great. All right. So if you had to bet your job on one AI-driven innovation for GlueIQ, just one, what would it be and why?

that's idea.

[@16:59](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1019.0) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

if you're different So do think It's a good Bet my job in what way?

[@17:02](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1022.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Like you said, you walk in to the rest of the LT and you say, guys, this is it. This is the thing that we absolutely must do.

Like, I'm putting all my chips on this. This is the investment or the initiative or the step we must take in AI to be, you know, ahead of the pack.

[@17:26](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1046.52) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I don't know if I have something yet. I would say if I did have something, would probably be some type of innovation that we haven't seen in the market yet.

But I think for the baseline stuff, we're starting to get to it already. So to answer your question, I don't really have something yet, so I wouldn't bet my job on anything yet.

Okay. I would say, you know, we're all very curious people as far as like coming up with something new.

And, you know, this is something that I've mentioned to you. That's like a stone, but more to like Maggie of like we have to come up with some type of white label product of some sort of thing because at the end of the day, like, you know, in coming from the consulting world, that's actually the model they're starting to adopt as well as they're almost like starting to, in advisory at least, they're starting to move away a little bit from services, right?

Like it's still a big part of what they do, but they've shifted like a good portion of the creative team and strategy teams to be less about client facing advisory services and a big portion like at PwC, they were starting to develop products, right?

So to give you an example, you know, they would look at tax automation, right? Or, you know, strategy automation of some sort or like vibe coding when it came to like UI and UX kind of experiences and stuff like that.

And they're actively making products. Like, they're literally making AI products using a lot of the tools that are off the shelf and some that are proprietary to them or things that they are developing.

But they're making products, and then they're selling these products to clients, right? So if I were to hedge my job, I would be like, we need to create some type of product or innovation that takes us away from the day-to-day kind of guillotine of relying on services and the fluctuations of a market and just develop a tool that is a little more steady and is an incremental kind of revenue stream, right?

So I would say that would be it. What it is, it doesn't exist yet. So that's the way I would think of it, right?

I don't Just something that doesn't exist that's really answering the needs of clients as a whole, right? And that can make money and give us some security.

[@20:00](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1200.9) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Very, very cool. I love that answer.

[@20:03](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1203.56) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

really do.

[@20:05](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1205.36) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And it ties into what you were saying before. If you could learn one thing, it would be around kind of AI product innovation.

Or just innovation in general, right?

[@20:16](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1216.08) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Like creating a new workflow, something that makes things a little bit more efficient. It doesn't have to be a product, but yeah, I would say it would be something around that.

Great.

[@20:29](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1229.2) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Who would you say are your top three AI-fluent people at GlueIQ? Not by title, but actual skill capability.

[@20:41](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1241.22) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I would say Casey, one of the ECB copywriters, he's pretty on top of it and just like constantly looking for tools.

I would say he's probably the top one and then... ... I haven't really seen any on the consulting side.

I haven't really seen any. Yeah, I would say between Alex Wexler, Casey, which is one of the writers, so art director, writer, and then , he's one of the senior art directors.

He's pretty much on top of it, too. They're always seeing what's out there as far as tools, new tools and stuff like that, and new hacks.

[@21:27](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1287.14) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I'd say those three, at least from the creative department.

[@21:29](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1289.36) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Again, haven't, like, as far as, I'm telling you, the account people and the project managers, I don't see them really tinkering with it too much, so.

Yeah.

[@21:38](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1298.16) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Was there a time recently when you went to any of those folks for help with AI or out of curiosity?

[@21:44](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1304.32) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, I mean, we're still working on it now. I'm telling you, it's an everyday part of our workflow now.

[@21:51](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1311.48) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

That's amazing. And sort of related to that, finger in the air, what percentage of people at GlueIQ... Who, would you say, are genuinely AI capable today?

[@22:05](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1325.38) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Across? Across the org, yeah.

[@22:08](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1328.86) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Across the org?

[@22:13](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1333.2) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I would say definitely heavier on the creative team. I haven't really talked much to the other ones, so it's hard to gauge what their fluency is.

I mean, I would say 75% of people are pretty fluent now. Out of that 75%, I would say maybe 30% to 40% are heavy users and are pretty competent and capable.

I mean, it all starts with Gaston, right? Gaston is a tinkerer. He's always looking for a new hack, a new tool, a new method, right?

And again, that comes from the top of the mountain down, right? So he's trying to get people ahead. So I would say, you know, I would say all of us...

So if we start from awareness being at 100%, like everybody knows about the tools, everybody knows about what's going on, I would say 75% of them are using it at some capacity, and I would say out of that 75%, I would say 30%, 35% are heavy users and are actively looking for new solutions, new ways of working, you know, using the technology to its potential.

Yeah, that's what I would say. Hopefully that answers your question. So 35% of the 75%? Correct. Yeah, okay. And do you guys have an AI upskilling budget or program or metrics for participation in learning AI?

No, I mean, we do have, okay, so early on we were all using our own personal kind of accounts, like MetJourney and all that kind of stuff.

Gastonas have recently started. to give us access to, like, Glue, you know, ChatGBT and stuff like that, and, you know, that beautiful AI, which is kind of like a presentation AI service or whatever.

So we are starting to get into it, you know, but it's not 100%. Like, there's still gaps, like, with MidJourney and stuff like that and, you know, Gemini and other things that are, like, up and coming.

So at a certain capacity, we're still using our own personal accounts on things that we are using for useful tools, if that makes sense.

yeah.

[@24:35](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1475.76) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Good. Thinking about kind of future capabilities, if you look out 18 months, what AI capability would you say GlueIQ needs that you definitely don't have today?

Or, put another way, what would Sam Altman or another tech disruptor do with AI in your industry to exploit that gap?

[@25:04](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1504.14) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I mean, video and imaging is pretty good, and I would imagine it's going to get better. As far as the gap, I mean, I know Matt has been looking at ways for us to improve just digital and product development from a web development, kind of app development perspective.

I think we do need to invest a little bit on upskilling on that because, again, it's just changing. And our creative team, I would say, is less digitally versed.

They're very strong with traditional advertising and stuff like that. So, I mean, I would say we definitely do need some upskilling on the digital product development side of the house.

But as far as an open gap of something... Everything that I see is untapped. I mean, I would say probably it would be around the product development side of the house.

[@26:09](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1569.52) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I see a lot of advancement in that.

[@26:13](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1573.82) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

New integrations into existing tools. So I would say like maybe more third-party support of plugins and stuff for like Adobe.

I see a lot of movement in that of people just creating almost like components and kits and stuff. to like add to it, you know?

And I did see that Adobe with like the Adobe beta is allowing for additional plugins that aren't native like Adobe Firefly kind of stuff that is within their ecosystem.

They're allowing like plugins from the outside and it's just using like credit usage. So I would say in the future, in the next 18 months, I would say that that would probably develop a little more, making it easier for people to make things, whether it's a product or an image generation or whatever.

in a different way. That's just what I'm seeing now. But again, who knows where we're going to be in six months.

This thing changes so fast.

[@27:12](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1632.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Fantastic. We're going to move to the next section, which is leverage. How are you currently measuring ROI on AI investments?

[@27:25](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1645.04) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Well, I'm not really tracking anything really right now. I would say if I did have a KPI, it wouldn't be like looking at a hard number.

I mean, I would say we could probably do, if we did have a KPI where we had to run a metric for, you know, it's saving us X amount of time and that equals X amount of dollars.

I mean, I would say that there is a lot of savings in that sense. We're just making things a lot faster.

With higher fidelity. So yeah, mean, there would be, I guess, if we needed to come up with a number, we could, but I'm not tracking anything actively right now.

[@28:15](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1695.76) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

AI governance. Who's ultimately accountable for AI ethics and responsible use?

[@28:22](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1702.12) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

That's a little bit of a gray area right now. I would say, you know, we've had, like, some basic training and stuff like that, but I think we could use a little bit more in that, right?

Like, I know security leaks are a big thing, right? Like, not making sure that everybody is cognizant of the stuff that they're putting into these things.

I know we started to develop our own, the thing is, in consulting, that was a very, very, very , like...

There was a lot of red tape in AI usage because some clients were like, absolutely no, right? So we had to, where I came from before, we had to invest heavily in having our own proprietary ecosystem that we can input stuff.

And even that was regulated heavily. Like if it was something that was, I guess, considered not top secret, but just like, you know, a new innovation or something.

It wasn't used at all. Like it was strict. And if you did use it, you had to kind of like whitewash the data, right?

Like you couldn't specify the name of the clients. It had to be in generic terms. And then you have to kind of like reverse engineer and bring it back.

So, yeah, I mean, I've been in environments where it's very strict. We're not that strict in all honesty, you know?

[@29:56](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1796.6) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And so you'd say it's a little bit fuzzy. You've had some trainings, and it doesn't sound like there's day-to-day accountability or an owner in this moment.

Is that fair to say?

[@30:08](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1808.28) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah, there isn't a cybersecurity specialist or something like that that's looking at stuff. And again, our clients aren't that sophisticated in that sense either.

I would say some are more than less. I would say an RBC is probably more strict than an AAP.

But then again, the nature of the work that we're doing, honestly, isn't really super proprietary work. I'll give you an example.

Coming from the consulting side, we were involved in literally coming from the CEO objectives and initiatives that were strategy-focused.

And business-focused. And it could be a big liability and a threat. If... That information were to be put into some type of environment where a competitor could get it, you know what mean?

Yeah.

[@31:07](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1867.18) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

But we're not doing that type of work here.

[@31:08](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1868.82) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Like, literally, we're just making ads, right? So it's like a lot of the stuff that we're using this stuff for is like, you know, help me come up with ideas for a brief of a product that is already pretty much in market or close to being in market.

So, yeah, there should be some, you know, obviously common sense and ethics that we're looking at it, right? Like, if you have to think about it, you probably shouldn't do it, you know?

One of those type of deals. But I would say that the nature of the stuff that we're doing isn't like top secret or like, you know, at least from what I've seen, you know?

A lot of the stuff that we're using is just like to come up with pictures and, you know, I would say, you know, maybe like on the RAM side, know, there's an unreleased product of a truck, but again, it's just like using renders or whatever and, you know.

So, but yeah, I guess to answer your question, I mean, yes, I think we can probably. get a little more strict and, you know, just to cover our own , you know, in case of a leak or whatever, you know, but yeah, I mean, currently today, we don't really have like a strict, I would say a strict process on that.

And then again, the type of work that we're doing, I wouldn't say is like top secret or like access to like business defining kind of things, you know?

Yeah.

[@32:26](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1946.92) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Can you tell me about a time that you, there was an AI tool or initiative that you invested in, but ultimately abandoned?

And if so, what happened and what did you learn?

[@32:42](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=1962.3) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Maybe some of the video stuff. I've tried it and it's just like been wonky and then I've like not used it again.

There's just some tools that are better than others. it's, it's promising. Use it. And it's like, ah, this is a piece of .

And then you stop using it. So I would say it was more around that. I mean, the stuff that I pay for has been stuff that I've done the trial, saw that it was useful, and then decided that it was worth the investment.

So I'm pretty strict on like not adding additional things to pay for that I don't need.

[@33:20](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2000.86) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah, I get that for sure. I understand a bit about how GlueIQ is structured and run. So this question may or may not be directionally right for how the organization exists, but understand it more as an example question.

If your board investors or partners challenged your AI investment tomorrow saying, prove this is worth it, what evidence would you show them?

And what question would you hope they don't ask?

[@33:56](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2036.5) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Again, it's going back to like what I was mentioning to you. I think we would. Be able to prove, you know, at least the tools that we're using today are creating things that we couldn't create before, saving time, like, very, very, very, very, very highly.

So, like, things that would take two days, three days, you can do in an hour, right, to give you an example.

yeah, proficiency and efficiency is at an all-time high in that sense. You're doing less, you're doing more with less people, right?

So you don't have to use a larger team. can use the tools and keep a shorter staff or a leaner staff.

So, I mean, there's a lot of efficiencies and savings just even from that. And all of our competitors are using it, right?

So if we don't use it, we're doing a disservice to ourselves, right? So, and putting ourselves at a disadvantage.

So, yeah, I mean, I think I could easily prove it if I needed to, just even with our base.

And I would even argue that we need to invest more on more tools and other things to make people even more efficient, more creative.

Yeah, I mean, it's just a matter of time. think if we, honestly, if we can use some type of tool, it would be for efficiency's sake.

I would say less on the creative end and more on the operational side of the house, I would say.

Because that seems to be a linchpin right now or an Achilles heel. So I would say we should double down on investment there and training and upskilling there.

Maybe less so on the creative end, even though that's always going to be an ongoing thing. So, yes, to answer your question, if I had to defend it, yes, I can.

And I could also build a business case on why we should invest more. What was the second half that I needed to answer?

[@35:58](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2158.12) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Sorry. What would What hope they don't ask?

[@36:03](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2163.38) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

What would I hope they don't ask? I guess it would say they don't probably be more on the liability and risk of potential threat of a leak or some like that.

I think it would be around that. Really, that's the only thing. mean, nobody's using it for like an unethical thing or anything like that.

But, you know, there's always a risk of a data leak here and there. So, I mean, I think that would be the thing to maybe be concerned about.

And then I would say, like, what are we doing as an agency to make sure that we're running it efficiently, but also in a way where it's not throttling productivity, right?

So just making sure that we are staying safe, but also, you know, allowing people to like use it to its full potential.

Because that's the thing that I did see from... Coming from consulting, that being adverse to risk came at an expense of productivity, if that makes sense, right?

Because we weren't using the latest models of stuff. We weren't using all the tools that were at full accessibility to others that other people were using, right?

So it's like you're always using the shorter stick, I guess you can say, right?

[@37:26](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2246.66) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Generation for Illustrations, to sell something to the client, the client that is liking it, and now wants to kind of move forward with further development of that stuff.

So, yeah, I mean, again, it's like a day-to-day, week-to-week thing where I'm seeing the effects of it. Cool.

[@39:16](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2356.62) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Very, very cool. And you spoke about all of our competitors are using AI. What is one thing your competitors deliver with AI that you can't match yet?

That's great. That's great. I don't think I've seen anything yet.

[@39:34](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2374.56) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

If they did, it would be what I was telling you, some type of innovation or product that we're like, , we should have done that.

We're not actively doing that, and that, I think, is a missed opportunity. But everything else, pretty much, I mean, the stuff that I've been seeing competitors do, we're doing, right?

Like image generation, video generation, audio generation, very much. They're still kind of playing in that box. haven't seen them, from what I've seen at least, because that's what the world sees.

I don't know how they would be using it from a strategy, research. I'm sure they're using it at the same capacity as we are, right?

But that would be interesting for me. If I could peek into what they were doing, I would want to see less about the outputs that people are using, because I'm very cognizant of what's going on in that space.

But I would want to see the stuff before the creative, like how are they using it for strategy and research?

How are they using it maybe to create new forms of business, right? Whether it's a product or something, right?

That's what I would see. Honestly, if I were to look at one company, I would say... What is RGA doing with it, right?

Because RGA has always been very, very good at every five years changing their model to something else. They've always been ahead of the curve of doing , whether it's on the creative side or even from just a business operation standpoint.

They're always doing stuff where they're becoming incubators for new products. They're always doing something different. I haven't heard much from them in the last year or so, but it'd be interesting to see what an agency like that would be doing with AI.

I'm sure they're going to come up with something they're like, damn it, that's smart.

[@42:06](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2526.78) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Again, I think it would be, I would have to put on my consulting hat more than creative, because I think the creative stuff hasn't really, honestly, it hasn't really changed much.

The marketing problems are still the same thing. It's all communication, and, you know, I think you would have to, and this is something, actually, I was talking to Maggie about a little bit yesterday.

It's like, in order to stay relevant, right, and especially in times like now, where budgets are being cut, and, you know, everybody's, it's always a pendulum swing, right?

It's like, clients are like, we hate agencies, bring it in-house, oh, , in-house sucks, give it back to people who are competent.

Yeah, this is always like a pendulum swing right now, and I see that we're going back to, you know, budgets being constricted, and, you know, them trying to get what they can for

And then bringing it in-house, you know? And I'm sure clients are starting to use these tools, right? So, like, you almost have to go beyond the tactical.

You have to go beyond the ask and be a trusted partner. And from what I've seen because of my consulting experience.

And also, they creep on our stuff too, right? On the marketing service side of the house. You know, because a lot of agency folks are starting to go in that field.

You know, they're like, hey, you know, we're all ex-agency folks. We can do that too, you know? And we'll undercut or whatever.

So everybody's always trying to take a piece of each other's lunch. And I mean, I would say for us to be better partners, we have to really look at it from what you were saying, right?

Like, what is their business problem? And is their problem solved by a piece of marketing and communication? Sometimes it might not be, right?

Sometimes it might be the development of some type of product or... You know, taking something that's antiquated and digitizing it, making it optimized, right?

So, like, you have to kind of see it from that perspective and really being a problem solver and being there for them to understand what the problems are, what are the implications of them, and then, you know, go back and solution for it.

So it's a different, I think it's a different muscle than what a typical agency would think of. And we're hybrid, so I think for us, we just have to have less separated kind of approaches to, you know, this is consulting, this is marketing services, and really start to being a little more integrated, because I think that's what clients are expecting in this day and age, you know?

[@44:45](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2685.41) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I appreciate that. That's good. That's good. The next stage is the Unite stage. So my first question is, what AI tools do you suspect your employees are using that are not officially approved?

[@45:05](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2705.28) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Well, I don't know if anybody's using anything that's not necessarily approved. mean, I think a lot of it is just the stuff that they would be using that's not approved, the stuff that they're paying for personally that they're bringing it to work, you know?

And that's okay?

[@45:22](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2722.39) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If that answers your question, mean, again, we don't really have like a hard policy of like, you know, if it's an external thing, can't bring it to work, you can't use it.

We haven't, you know, we haven't reached that point yet. Yeah.

[@45:46](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2746.72) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[@45:49](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2749.0) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's the risk, of course, is on the governance and ethics side. But yeah.

[@45:56](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2756.93) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

That's always, that's always, that's that's always the balance, you know? And again, things change so much, dude, that it's like there's always a new thing.

And again, like you were saying, the tinkering culture, creative culture is very much like what's the next new shiny toy that's going to make something bigger, bigger, badder, better, faster than anybody else.

You know, I think that's that's that's the thing. So, yeah, I mean, as far as what I'm aware, nothing that would be a red flag.

You know, I mean, honestly, if I did see something that was a red flag, I would say something about it, you know.

But but the tools, the tools that people are using right now are just to make their workflow and creative better.

So, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say that there's anything that's a huge risk right now.

[@46:45](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2805.54) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

The next question, I think I'm going to answer. I believe I can answer it. So if you can just validate that we can kind of skip through this one.

So the next question is, who is in your in your organization has access to AI power? What's the picture of who can see what?

And my understanding is that pretty much everybody has access to AI insights across the org. Is that correct?

[@47:12](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2832.99) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Well, I'm going to ask the question of insights in what sense, right? Because, yes, everybody has general access to insights through like a chat GPT or Gemini or whatever, and they can mine for insights that way.

But, again, I come from consulting, and they would have tools like Forrester and other things that are a little more advanced.

Those advanced tools, no, we don't. At least I don't have access to them.

[@47:41](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2861.23) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Okay. That's good. This is a question I really love. Name the top three specific changes needed for AI adoption to feel natural rather than forced at GlueIQ.

[@47:59](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2879.31) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Name the specific changes I needs you. Hmm. I mean, again, from the tribe that I work with, it's already there.

[@48:07](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2887.27) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It's pretty much natural.

[@48:09](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2889.75) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

And again, it's coming from Gaston and him bringing it back to the tribe. I would say it's already there.

I don't think we really need to change much more of it. But I think the people who are on the fence of using it should be using it.

And they should also be innovating in their own discipline to try to come up with newer. I think everybody should be on the innovation, right?

It shouldn't be just the creative team or the strategy team. I think the whole agency at some capacity in their own discipline should be using it to get better and make things more streamlined and optimized.

[@48:53](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2933.71) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

What happens when an employee wants to use client data with an AI tool? Is there an approval process?

[@49:02](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2942.95) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

No, other than, you what I was saying, you know, if you have to think about it twice, you probably shouldn't do it.

But yeah, there isn't, there isn't, and again, it varies by client, client by client, right? Some are going to be a little more strict than others, so, but yeah, there isn't like a clearly defined, like, this is the protocol you should take in order to do something, you know?

[@49:30](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2970.53) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Fantastic. We're going to move to the last stage. Maybe we can get through it in the next nine minutes.

[@49:35](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2975.05) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Let's see.

[@49:38](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=2978.25) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

So this is Evolve, and the first question is, name your three most AI advanced competitors. So it sounds like RGA, you believe, may be one of them.

Any other two? And I know you've shared that you think you guys are definitely leading and out in front, but is there anything specific?

[@50:03](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3003.25) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I mean, I would say, again, like, maybe less on the agency side, but I would say when you look at people like PwC or like an Accenture or something like that, that is already doing the hybrid thing, I think those are a bigger threat than like a Wiley and Kennedy, right?

Or a traditional marketing agency, because again, marketing agencies are, they're stuck in one lane, right? They're pretty much just executing on one thing.

I think to me, the bigger threat are those larger shops are playing in the same hybrid space because they can affect business and storytelling and marketing and all the other stuff.

And I know because I still talk with a lot of my colleagues, they're always... coming up with the next big thing, trying to sell the next big process, and they're looking at new ways of working, whether it's vibe coding, which is the new thing, or whatever the hell, new thing that they're coming up with, they're actively always trying to find something for that, and I think we fall behind in that way.

So I think that would be the biggest threat, and again, they're building their own products, so they're actively doing things that I'm like, oh, you know, as things constrict, like you always have to find a new way of doing things, and working, or new offering, or something, and I don't see that happening, you know?

Yeah, yeah.

[@51:44](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3104.99) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

If we surveyed your clients about whether you're an AI leader or laggard compared to other agencies, what would they honestly say?

[@51:56](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3116.25) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I think it would depend on... ... ... I think the ones that we're actively working with, some are like, that's fantastic, and I can't believe that you just did that, right?

Like, oh, you came up with a video, you know, for a banner ad that we weren't totally expecting. So some are surprised and delighted.

I would say some are like, okay, that's the general expectation is that you're using it, and everybody else is using it.

So I'm talking more about like a client like Ram, they're, you know, they're working with agencies that are doing full video rips, just like we're doing.

So I would say it's just another day of business and not front for like a client like Ram, but somebody like an AAP is like, oh, man, you know, you made a Mustang come to life and do a drift.

We weren't expecting that. were expecting a static. They're super happy and surprised and delighted by some of that stuff.

I would say where we do lack, I think, is in being. In forefront of having an opinion in the market, right?

Like if we're creating white papers or having a point of view, doing keynote speeches, that kind of , I think we're lacking them.

So I guess being a trusted voice or a trusted source of information and being almost a futurist in that sense, I don't see us doing that.

I think we're just keeping up, you know, but not really, we're not leaping forward, I guess, if that answers your question.

So I would say if clients would, I think clients who, like, let's say we wanted to work with a Google or something like that, right?

Where they're like at the forefront, like actively making the new wave of stuff, they would look at us and be like, they're behind, right?

Because we're really not innovating in any sense. So it wasn't a direct answer, but no, it's a good answer.

[@54:00](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3240.01) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

It actually, it leads in really well to the next question, which is, if a competitor launched an AI service tomorrow that made GlueIQ's offering 50% faster and 30% cheaper, how quickly could you respond and what would block you?

[@54:18](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3258.39) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

So if they came to us with something that's like, this is something that you need?

[@54:22](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3262.47) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, no, this is a competitor out in the marketplace. It says, positioned against you guys, delivering the same services you're delivering, and they've figured out a way with AI to deliver 50% faster and 30% cheaper.

How quickly do you think GlueIQ as an organization could respond, and what would block you?

[@54:50](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3290.53) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I think we would, we could respond pretty quickly now how efficient, I think that's where the Achilles heel is, right?

Like on. Not having enough people to dedicate to the innovation, maybe not having the process completely thought through, but I think we would give it our best shot.

How good it's going to be, I think that would be the question. think conceptually, can come up with something really strong.

I think we'd fall apart a little bit on the execution. We would fall apart in the execution and delivery, the optimization, and that's, I think, where we would fall apart.

So if a competitor came to us and said, we can outthink them, outrun them with this new product and how we respond, I think we would have ideas very quickly on things that we can do, but we would fall apart, I think, a little bit on running to build it and do it because we just don't have the infrastructure for it or the people.

[@55:59](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3359.47) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. So everybody's just pretty much tapped on work.

[@56:02](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3362.53) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

You would need, like, to give you an example, going back to, like, a PWC, there was a dedicated team to just doing exactly what you're saying.

[@56:10](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3370.99) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@56:11](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3371.19) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

If you would come up with some white-labeled product, they would literally have, they would man a team, full spectrum of strategists, what we call the BXT, so it was business experience and technology.

So we would have business leaders, strategists, insight gatherers, people who can build business plans, all that . They would build the infrastructure for the operational, operation of the product, the deployment of the product, so the full plan, right?

They would then kick it off to the experience team to come up with a concept for it, an experience for it, build it, and then work with the technology team to actually implement the thing, make it work.

Yeah. know, and get it to be operationalized, you know, and then it would be full spectrum all over again to them bringing it into market, you know, get it to scale, all that kind of stuff.

We don't operate like that at all. Got it.

[@57:14](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3434.85) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

At all.

[@57:15](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3435.49) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

We are not ready for that, man. So, yeah, would we be ready? I don't think so, man. I think we'd get our lunch taken from us just from the experience that I've had at other places.

[@57:29](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3449.05) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Yeah.

[@57:31](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3451.93) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Could we maybe hack it with a two or two? Yeah, but I just, I think it would be a bucket full of holes, man, honestly, if I'm being honest.

No, I appreciate that.

[@57:41](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3461.51) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And I think your experience working in other shops and understanding kind of the scale and the resources is, you know, that's a good grounding point, right?

[@57:49](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3469.49) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Yeah. Yeah.

[@57:51](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3471.87) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

As AI handles more analytical and routine work, what uniquely human value does GlueIQ? What you like to bring that becomes more important, and how are you doubling down on it?

[@58:06](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3486.39) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Story.

[@58:08](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3488.91) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Story is a big one.

[@58:11](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3491.99) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I think we go back to, we're always going back to the human need and looking at it from a very human perspective.

So I think that is the bigger differentiator. You know, Glue is never going to be, never ever going to think really about emotions or anything like that.

So I think that would be, that's something that we are actively doing, and something that we should continue to double down on, is human insight, human stories, human emotion.

How are humans going to, like, everything should be human-centered, you know? Yeah. I love that.

[@58:52](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3532.25) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I know we're at time. I have three wrap-up questions. I can still do a second one, yeah, absolutely.

[@58:58](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3538.27) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Correct.

[@58:59](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3539.71) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

We've Touched on this already in a variety of ways, but it's asking it in sort of a different way.

What is one specific AI capability or use case where GlueIQ is genuinely ahead of the market, in your view?

[@59:20](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3560.27) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Product development, for sure. I think the typical stuff we're in, right, like music, image, video generation, strategy usage, research usage, I think the stuff that we know how to do well, we're using it.

But on the things that are maybe net new stretch goals or stretch capabilities, it's, you know, we might have some space there to maybe improve on that.

It just depends. If you talk to Matt, he's really actively looking at stuff, but we would have to figure out a way to operationalize that, I guess.

To me, that's the biggest Achilles heel that we have is we have great ideas on consulting and creative side, but then how do we operationalize it in a way where we're staffing things correctly, where we're giving the appropriate allotted time that's clear and deliverable.

So more of the operational side of the house is, I think, the area that we should really focus on.

I hope that answers your questions.

[@1:00:39](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3639.27) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

No, it's great. So closing questions are, what is the uncomfortable truth about GlueIQ's AI transformation that everyone knows but no one says out loud?

[@1:00:56](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3656.87) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Thank you. You I don't think I've seen a gorilla in the corner, you know? Yeah, I mean, I would go back to, like, what I was just saying, right?

Like, I think we're all ambitious and have good ideas. It's just how do we make them a reality and part of the workflow?

And, you know, I don't know. I think that's the ugly truth is we just need to get better at, you know, seeing things through and operationalizing and making it, you know, so it makes things easier and not, like, yet another thing to do, you know?

Yeah, I mean, I think that would be it. But other than that, I don't see, like, a big hairy, you know, elephant in the room or anything like that yet, you know?

[@1:01:45](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3705.99) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

Cool. I think you kind of answered this with your answer to that question. But the next one is, what's the one thing, if you don't address in the next 90 days, could derail your AI transformation?

I think I'm hearing you say kind of process, operation.

[@1:02:06](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3726.17) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

Process, operation, making sure everybody has access to the tools and they're not, you know, that kind of stuff. I think if you can get also ahead of the game too.

So if you can create a process where if there's a new tool, how do you vet it and make it accessible to people faster?

Risk mitigation, I think, is important. I think that's it, really. Awesome.

[@1:02:37](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3757.61) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

And last question, what surprised you most about our conversation today?

[@1:02:48](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3768.13) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

I think it's good that we're doing this just because, you know, again, I think the leadership team is really, you know, trying to make things better.

So I wouldn't say I'm surprised by anything.

[@1:03:03](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3783.75) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

I think it's good that we're having this discussion.

[@1:03:08](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3788.75) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

But yeah, I mean, overall, I think it's a good initiative to be doing. I'm not surprised, honestly, by anything.

Noel, thank you so much.

[@1:03:17](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3797.81) \- **Alex Schwartz (disruptedwork.com)**

You've been incredibly clear, concise, transparent. You know, this will help us identify opportunities, risks, and we'll aggregate everything and share back with you when everything is completed.

Awesome.

[@1:03:32](https://fathom.video/share/dKPyNsNK_iLBfx8yXZ-B7DdtsZ8or9VE?timestamp=3812.21) \- **noel.artiles (GlueIQ)**

We're going to get a readout of some sort? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Awesome. I look forward to reading that.

Awesome. Thank you, my friend. Be well. Have a beautiful day. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.
