# AI TRANSFORMATION LEADERSHIP: THE HUMAN GLUE EXECUTIVE BOOTCAMP
**UCF STLI Faculty Design Sprint Proposal**
**Submitted: October 3, 2025**

---

## THE PRODUCT: Executive Bootcamp → Certificate → Scalable Platform

**AI Transformation Leadership** is a 3-day executive bootcamp that teaches leaders how to assess organizational AI readiness, lead human-centered technology adoption, and implement sustainable transformation. Unlike technical AI courses, this focuses on the **human dimension of AI implementation**—the leadership, culture, and change management that determines whether AI initiatives succeed or fail.

**Format Options:**
- **Flagship:** 3-day intensive executive bootcamp (in-person at UCF)
- **Scalable:** 6-week hybrid certificate program (2 in-person days + virtual modules)
- **Enterprise:** Customized on-site programs for Pegasus Partners and major employers
- **Future:** Online micro-credential and pathway to executive master's program

**Curriculum Modules:**
1. **AI Readiness Assessment** - Diagnostic frameworks to measure organizational maturity across technical, cultural, and governance dimensions
2. **Human-Centered Change Management** - Leading cross-functional teams through AI adoption without breaking culture
3. **Emotional Intelligence in the AI Age** - Navigating human resistance, fear, and adaptation
4. **Strategic AI Implementation** - From pilot to scale: avoiding the "proof-of-concept graveyard"
5. **Ethics, Governance & Risk** - Building responsible AI frameworks for regulated industries
6. **Leading Hybrid Human-AI Teams** - Managing the intersection of automation and human talent

## TARGET AUDIENCES: Clear Market Demand

**Primary:**
- **C-Suite Executives** at mid-to-large enterprises ($50M+ revenue) implementing AI
- **Chief Transformation Officers / Chief Digital Officers** leading AI initiatives
- **VP-level leaders** in Technology, Operations, HR responsible for AI adoption

**Secondary:**
- **Government & Defense** - Aerospace, simulation, modeling & defense contractors (UCF's backyard: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, NASA contractors)
- **Healthcare Systems** - Hospital executives navigating AI in patient care, diagnostics, operations
- **Financial Services** - Banks and fintech companies balancing AI innovation with risk management
- **Manufacturing** - Companies implementing Industry 4.0, robotics, predictive maintenance

**Why They Need This:**
- 85% of AI projects fail to deliver business value (Gartner)
- #1 failure reason: not technology, but **organizational change management**
- Executives are technically literate but lack frameworks to lead **human transformation**
- No one teaches the "glue" between AI strategy and successful adoption

## THE HOOK: Why UCF Owns This Lane

**1. Geographic & Industry Advantage**
- **Orlando = Simulation Capital of the World** - Digital twins, modeling, human-machine systems (UCF IST, SREAL)
- **Space Coast proximity** - Commercial space, aerospace, defense tech requiring human-AI collaboration
- **Theme park innovation** - Disney, Universal pioneering AI in customer experience and operations
- **Healthcare & Life Sciences hub** - UCF Lake Nona Medical City, AdventHealth, Nemours

**2. Unique Cross-Disciplinary Assets**
- **Psychology of Technology Adoption** - UCF has deep expertise in human factors, simulation psychology, change behavior
- **Engineering + Business Integration** - CECS collaboration on AI/ML technical depth + business application
- **Communication & Persuasion** - Nicholson School experts in organizational communication, crisis management
- **Ethics & Philosophy** - Emerging tech ethics, AI governance frameworks

**3. The "Human Glue" Differentiation**
- **Georgia Tech / MIT** = Technical AI mastery, but light on human/organizational change
- **ASU / Harvard** = Leadership development, but lack technical AI credibility
- **UCF STLI** = **The only program that bridges technical AI literacy with human-centered implementation**

**Competitive Positioning:**
"We don't teach you to code AI. We teach you to lead humans through AI transformation."

## BOTTOM LINE

This is **not** another generic AI course. This is UCF staking a claim on the **most valuable, least addressed problem in AI adoption**: teaching leaders how to transform humans and organizations, not just deploy technology.

**The market is desperate for this.** Executives are drowning in technical AI training but starving for frameworks to lead their people through transformation.

**UCF is uniquely positioned to own this.** No other university combines Orlando's industry ecosystem, cross-disciplinary depth, and practical orientation.

**This is a $3M+ revenue opportunity** that puts money in faculty pockets, elevates UCF's national reputation, and solves a real problem for companies investing billions in AI.

Let's build this.
