### 2.2 Return Categories & Calculation Methods

#### A. Employee Retention Savings
**Formula**: (Reduced Turnover Rate × Average Replacement Cost) × Number of Employees

**Baseline Metrics**:
- Average turnover cost: $75,000 - $150,000 per employee
- Typical improvement: 25-50% reduction in turnover
- Implementation timeframe: 6-12 months

**Example Calculation** (1000 employees, 15% annual turnover):
```
Current Annual Turnover Cost: 150 × $100,000 = $15,000,000
Improved Turnover Rate: 10% (33% reduction)
New Annual Turnover Cost: 100 × $100,000 = $10,000,000
Annual Savings: $5,000,000
```

#### B. Productivity Enhancement
**Formula**: (Productivity Increase % × Total Payroll) × Efficiency Factor

**Baseline Metrics**:
- Average productivity gain: 15-35%
- Implementation timeline: 3-9 months
- Sustained improvement: 80% of gains maintained long-term

**Example Calculation** (1000 employees, $80,000 average salary):
```
Total Annual Payroll: 1000 × $80,000 = $80,000,000
Productivity Increase: 20%
Efficiency Factor: 0.7 (conservative estimate)
Annual Value: $80,000,000 × 0.20 × 0.7 = $11,200,000
```

#### C. Recruitment & Training Cost Reduction
**Formula**: (Hiring Volume Reduction × Cost per Hire) + (Training Efficiency × Training Budget)

**Baseline Metrics**:
- Average cost per hire: $15,000 - $25,000
- Training cost reduction: 30-60%
- Time to productivity improvement: 40-70%

**Example Calculation**:
```
Annual Hiring Volume: 150 positions
Cost per Hire: $20,000
Hiring Reduction: 30% (45 fewer hires)
Hiring Savings: 45 × $20,000 = $900,000

Training Budget: $2,000,000
Training Efficiency Gain: 40%
Training Savings: $2,000,000 × 0.40 = $800,000
Total Savings: $1,700,000
```

#### D. Performance Improvement Revenue
**Formula**: (Revenue per Employee × Performance Gain %) × Employee Count

**Baseline Metrics**:
- Average revenue per employee: $150,000 - $300,000
- Performance improvement: 10-25%
- Revenue realization timeline: 6-18 months

**Example Calculation**:
```
Revenue per Employee: $200,000
Performance Improvement: 15%
Employee Count: 1000
Additional Revenue: 1000 × $200,000 × 0.15 = $30,000,000
```

### 2.3 ROI Calculation Summary

#### Three-Year ROI Model (1000 employees example)

**Year 1**:
```
Investment: $200,000 (implementation + first year)
Returns: $15,900,000
Net ROI: 7,850%
```
