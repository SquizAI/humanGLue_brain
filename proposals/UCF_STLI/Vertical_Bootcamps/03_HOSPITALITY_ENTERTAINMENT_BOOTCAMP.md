## BOTTOM LINE (HOSPITALITY VERTICAL)

The hospitality AI market is:
- **Massive:** Every hotel, theme park, restaurant, and cruise line needs guest experience innovation
- **Competitive:** Guest expectations rising (Netflix-level personalization)

- **High-volume:** More potential clients than healthcare or aerospace (lower barriers to entry)

**UCF STLI can own hospitality AI education in the Southeast.**

With Disney, Universal, Rosen College, and Orlando's tourism ecosystem, we have unmatched access.

**This is a $3M+ standalone revenue stream from hospitality alone.**
