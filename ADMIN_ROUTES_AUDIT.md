## Recently Fixed Routes

### ✅ Fixed: Missing `/new` Routes

**Issue:** The admin dashboard quick actions were linking to `/admin/courses/new` and `/admin/experts/new` which returned 404 errors.

**Solution:** Created full-page forms for both routes:

1. **`/admin/courses/new`** (CREATED)
   - Full-page course creation form
   - All fields from courses modal: title, instructor, category, level, duration, lessons, price, description, image, status
   - Form validation with error messages
   - Image preview functionality
   - Success message with auto-redirect to `/admin/courses`
   - Cancel button returns to courses list
   - File: `/app/admin/courses/new/page.tsx`

2. **`/admin/experts/new`** (CREATED)
   - Full-page expert profile creation form
   - All fields: name, title, company/location, email, phone, LinkedIn, hourly rate, years of experience, availability, status, specialties, bio, image
   - Email validation
   - Image preview functionality
   - Success message with auto-redirect to `/admin/experts`
   - Cancel button returns to expert network
   - File: `/app/admin/experts/new/page.tsx`

## Quick Actions Navigation (from Dashboard)

The admin dashboard (`/admin/page.tsx`) includes these quick action links:

| Add New Course | `/admin/courses/new` | ✅ Working |
| Add Expert | `/admin/experts/new` | ✅ Working |
| Upload Content | `/admin/content` | ✅ Working |

## Technical Details

### Common Components Used
- `DashboardSidebar` - Admin navigation sidebar
- `useChat` context - User authentication and admin role check
- `framer-motion` - Animations and transitions
- `next/link` - Navigation
- `next/navigation` - Router for redirects
- `next/image` - Optimized image rendering

### Authentication
All admin routes check for `userData?.isAdmin` and redirect to `/login` if not authorized.

### Form Patterns
- Local state management with `useState`
- Form validation with error state
- Async save simulation
- Success messages with auto-redirect
- Cancel actions with navigation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional `/new` Routes
Based on the pattern, these routes could benefit from dedicated creation pages:

- `/admin/workshops/new` - Create new workshop
- `/admin/assessments/new` - Create new assessment
- `/admin/users/new` - Add new user (if not using modal)
- `/admin/organizations/new` - Add new organization
- `/admin/services/new` - Create new service

**Note:** Currently, these pages use modal dialogs for creation, which is also a valid UX pattern.

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add breadcrumb navigation to all pages
2. Implement real database integration (currently using mock data)
3. Add edit pages (e.g., `/admin/courses/[id]/edit`)
4. Add detail/view pages (e.g., `/admin/courses/[id]`)
5. Implement proper error handling and loading states
6. Add file upload for images instead of URL input
7. Add rich text editor for descriptions and bios
